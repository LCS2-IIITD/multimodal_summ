Or that you need a library that performs basic image and video processing tasks, so that you apply your largest scale concept. Or even you need to develop an application that initially performs ASR in order to provide personalized services to elderly people in Greece. In all these cases you may develop everything from scratch (obviously a bad choice), or you can select from a number of tools/libraries/APIs already residing in open source repositories. Then you would have to learn how to use/embed (each and every one of them), integrate them in your own project and test that everything works smoothly. Wrong selection of components will inevitably lead to great delays or even failure, and this is something that you surely would like to avoid… The talk will provide an overview of the modern open source multimedia tools landscape, from the perspective of reusability, maintainability and developer perceived quality. It will discuss the popularity of tools/libraries/APIs with respect to the development context they are used (desktop/server/mobile) and will provide useful insight on how to select the proper component for the right job."
http://videolectures.net/multimediamodeling2019_larson_data_minimization/,"Conventionally, multimedia researchers have adhered to the maxim “There is no data like more data”. However, the new General Data Protection Regulation, which came into force in Europe in 2018, has caused the data science world to shift its perspective. If there are constraints on how data can be gathered and used, then researchers must adapt themselves to design effective algorithms and systems under those constraints. In this talk, we look at how “data greed” has characterized past research on analyzing multimedia content and discover why it is time to revisit our assumption that more data will lead to better performance of algorithms. The talk covers examples of research on data dropping and data bleaching that make the case for the potential of data minimization, and motivation the need for future work in that direction. Finally, we point out that techniques focusing on how to perturb or remove information in multimedia data have a potential to protect the privacy of users, without requiring them to stop sharing their images and videos online."
