http://videolectures.net/sikdd2017_brank_wikipedia_concepts/,We describe an efficient approach for annotating a document with relevant concepts from the Wikipedia. A pagerank-based method is used to identify a coherent set of relevant concepts considering the input document as a whole. The proposed approach is suitable for parallel processing and can support any language for which a sufficiently large Wikipedia is available.
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2017_mladenic_news_events/,"In this work we investigate how news events can be used to predict the financial markets. Namely we built a time series model that includes features obtained from the news and investigated whether the changes in volume of traded shares can be predicted more accurately with this information. The time series model that was built is of an ARMA-GARCH type, because we wanted to account for any clustering of the volatility that is normal for the financial markets. The models were evaluated with the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion, while also being compared to the base-line model that did not include any features from the news. Overall our results show that there is an improvement in the model when the information from the news is used and hence show a promising avenue for future research work."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2017_pita_costa_public_health/,"Real-time global media monitoring is nowadays an essential resource to public health. Multilingual capabilities can enrich this potential allowing a worldwide overview based on online news sources, blog posts or social media. In this paper we propose research topics related with the exploration text mining tools used to provide real-time global media monitoring in the context of health. We aim to understand how media can contribute to a better overview of health related and well being matters. With it we shall also identify open research questions that motivate further technological development to better fit the needs, interests and workflow of public health professionals."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2017_kladnik_topic_profiles/,"Audience segmentation is often applied on Web portals to gain insights into the audience, support targeted marketing and in general provide on-line recommendations to the users. We propose an approach to audience segmentation that is based on using machine learning on topic profiles of the visited content. Our preliminary experiments on a small sample of log-data show that the proposed approach is promising and the proposed combination of features capturing short term and long-term user interest gives better results than using only the short-term interests of the user."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2017_herga_detail_records/,"Data collected from mobile phones can be used to uncover underlying social network dynamics and individual's behavioral patterns. Based on a Call Details Records dataset, we build a weighted, directed network and analyze it's properties. In addition to node-level network measures we extract an extensive consumption and mobility-based feature set. We show that extracted network and consumption features can be used to model individual's risk profile."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2017_novak_skill_demand/,"Todays job market demand from the job seekers to continuously learn new skills. When applying for a job position one must have the required skill set. If the applicant is missing a skill it can be learned by attending a course. Finding the appropriate courses can be tedious but necessary work to be up-to-date with the job market demand. In this paper, we present a dashboard which connects the job market skill demand with the courses that give the required skill knowledge. We developed a pipeline for continuous crawling of job postings and courses which feeds the dashboard with the appropriate data. The dashboard allows searching by keywords and returns relevant job postings, courses and basic statistics relevant to the given search query."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2017_skraba_execution_anomalies/,"Anomaly detection (a.k.a. outlier detection) is the identification of events that do not conform to an expected pattern in a dataset. When applied to monitoring modern, complex IT systems, it keeps track of a plethora of incoming data streams. This paper provides an approach that uses the lowest and most unstructured source of data related to an IT system - the raw system log files. Several versions and parametrizations of basic building blocks will be presented to show how different types of anomalies can be extracted from the data. Several experiments on synthetic as well as real-world data show effectiveness of the algorithm. Special care is taken to keep the model and the resulting alerts interpretable - since detecting an error without a meaningful explanation about its details is of limited use to end user (the results need to be actionable)."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2017_kenda_higgs_boson/,"Real-time classification of events in high energy physics is essential to deal with huge amounts of data, produced by proton-proton collisions in ATLAS detector at Large Hadron Collider in CERN. With this work we have implemented a triggering mechanism method for saving relevant data, based on machine learning. In comparison with the state of the art machine learning methods (gradient boosting and deep neural networks) shortcomings of Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been compensated with extensive feature engineering. Method has been evaluated with special metrics (average median significance) suggested by the domain experts. Our method achieves significantly higher precision and 8% lower average median significance than the current state of the art method used at ATLAS detector (XGBoost)."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2017_pita_costa_data_analysis/,"Networks are important representations in computer science to communicate structural aspects of a given system of interacting components. The evolution of a network has several topological properties that can provide us information on the network itself. In this paper, we present a methodology to compare the the topological characteristics of the evolution of a network, encoded into a (persistence) diagram that tracks the lifetimes of those features. This will enable us to classify the evolution of networks based on the distance between the diagrams that represent such network evolution. In that, we also consider complex vectors that bring a complementary perspective to the distance-based classification that is closer to the computational methods, aims to enhance the computational efficiency of those comparisons, and that is by itself a source of open research questions."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2017_kocbek_mortality_prediction/,"Numerous severity assessment scores for estimation of in-hospital mortality in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have been developed over the last 40 years. In this study, we predicted 1-month mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients using the open Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. Additionally, we observed the improvement in predictive performance and interpretability of the baseline model used in ICUs to a more complex model using simple features such as unigrams or bigrams, as well as advanced features extracted from textual nursing notes. For the latter, MetaMap extraction tool was used to extract medical concepts based on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) terminology. We used a logistic regression based classifier, built using Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), age and gender, as a baseline model. The baseline model was then compared to regularized logistic regression based classifier built using simple and more complex additional features. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) results for the baseline predictive performance improved from of 0.761 to 0.782 when frequency of unigrams and bigrams were used to build the model. In a similar scenario, where unigram and bigram frequency was replaced with Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) based feature values, AUC further increased to 0.786. This paper represents an opportunity in extracting new knowledge in the form of unigrams, bigrams or concepts extracted from textual notes accompanied by regression coefficient values that can be interpreted as relations between the features and the outcome. The combination of both can provide added value in decision support systems in ICU departments, where data is collected in electronic medical records (EMRs) in real-time."
