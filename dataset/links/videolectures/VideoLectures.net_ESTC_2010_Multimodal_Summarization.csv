http://videolectures.net/estc2010_henning_bwlsrd/,"Mendeley started as three guys in a virtual garage in 2007 - and has grown to become the world's largest research collaboration platform less than two years after its public launch in 2008. Used by more than 500,000 academics and industry researchers, Mendeley enables researchers to manage documents, arrange collaborative projects, work and discuss in groups, as well as share data across Mendeley’s web platform. Along the way, Mendeley picked up awards like ""European Start-Up of the Year"" at the 2009 Plugg Conference in Brussels, ""Best Social Innovation Which Benefits Society"" at the 2009 TechCrunch Europe Awards, and ""Start-Up Most Likely To Change The World For The Better"" at the 2010 Guardian Activate Summit. Mendeley has received venture capital from the founders and executives behind Skype, Last.fm and Warner Music Group, as well as research grant funding from the European Union and UK's Technology Strategy Board and Joint Information Systems Committee. Victor will share his experiences in taking Mendeley from an idea by German Ph.D. students to a 35-person start-up with offices in London and New York, and talk about Mendeley's plans for the future - including a crowdsourced semantic database and research application contest."

In this talk, we discuss and illustrate some of the ways in which Yahoo employs semantic technologies to improve the user experience for both web search users and the visitors of its Internet sites."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_schaffert_pfbsm/,"KiWi is an open-source development platform for building Semantic Social Media applications. It offers features required for Social Media applications such as versioning, (semantic) tagging, rich text editing, easy linking, rating and commenting, as well as advanced ""smart"" services such as recommendations, intelligent search, a sophisticated social reputation system, vocabulary management, and rich visualisation. KiWi can be used both, as a platform for building custom Semantic Social Media applications and as a Semantic Social Index, integrating content and data from a variety of different sources, e.g. wikis, blogs and content management systems in a enterprise intranet. Third-party applications can access the KiWi system using simple-to-use web services. KiWi v1.0 – “Running Free”."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_wurzer_dbvled/,Linked Enterprise Data goes beyond Semantic Web by including any data sources in an outside of business processes. The presentation shows how Linked Enterprise Data not only slimline it infrastructure but also enables automatic information logistics to combine process management and information retrieval. It is a way to reduce complexity challenging information growth and process variety and flexibility. Practical examples show the business needs and the implementation of related solutions to enable rationalization and quality assurance.
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_fensel_sssm/,"The project SESAME uses semantic technology in creating a technical solution that integrates smart metering and demand management, and building automation. Employing policy-based reasoning, it offers an energy-optimization capability both for the energy consumer and provider. The information used is coming from sensors of multiple domains, including the physical sensors (such as temperature, light, presence) and the information sensors from the energy management domain services, as well as the structured data from user profiles, policies, and external information sources. The SESAME approach is implemented and validated as an extensible smart home demonstrator system which provides a proof-of-concept for its innovative energy efficiency solution."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_wong_stwma/,"With the exponent growth of social media network, the internet landscape has once again been re-defined. Commercial companies have been exploiting social media network ; not just another media platform, but fast becoming a major platform for marketing. With this platform, marketing managers and marketing agencies are struggling to gather feedbacks, analyse the results and re-strategized their marketing plans. Ultimately, allocating and justifying the online marketing budget. This session will give you some insight on how Semantic Web is deployed as an application to gather the vast amount of online media data and effectively convert them into valuable information for campaign managers and marketing agencies."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_baker_ttfcc/,"Funded by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and the Atlantic Innovation Foundation, Innovatia Inc. have pioneered the design and testing of semantic technologies for use by Contact Centre agents who provide Technical Support to customers in the Telecommunications sector. This is in response to increasing contact center costs for companies whose products and information support services must rapidly evolve. Numerous opportunities exist for increasing the productivity of knowledge workers involved in searching separate and disconnected product-specific knowledge bases, case resolution databases, training manuals and technical documentation. Our technical solution comprises of OWL-DL knowledge base populated from a wide variety of document formats with sentence-triples generated by a telecommunications-specific text mining pipeline that leverages document segmentation techniques to instantiate with state of the art precision and recall. This talk will outline critical features of the platform and the performance of agents using the prototype with various user interface tools from commercial vendors with customized features to test this search paradigm. Pilot studies required agents to troubleshoot customer queries from fault symptoms to root causes and to identify procedures to resolve the causes of faults. During testing agents used visual queries, advanced dynamic form-based search, and SPARQL queries saved as frequently asked questions. In particular we have validated that Tier 1 agents can navigate a sequence of workflows resulting in an increase in findability from 75 to 100% under real time conditions and overall search time has been reduced by 50%. Moreover, time savings can be made at the critical junction of case handoff from Tier 1 to Tier 2 agents, such that Tier 1 agents can achieve better performance. We review contact center performance metrics and comment the on the suitability of Semantic Technologies for this business process as well as issues related to rollout and adoption of this platform across the enterprise."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_schwetz_intro/,"After the sucessful initiation of the Innovation Seed Camp last year (based on the previous ESTC business idea competitions), ESTC2010 continues this tradition, offering those with innovative business ideas involving the use of semantics or Internet technology the chance to reach out to the exploitation network of experts and investors."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_wilson_e3d/,"The success of 3D TV in the home hinges on recreating the immersive experience that audiences enjoy so much in the cinema. However, standardized 3D film content distribution formats require the viewer to sit in a specific position relative to the display in order for the optical illusion behind the ""3D experience"" to provide a realistic sensation of depth. As most home cinema systems are configured around the viewer rather than the technology, many consumers will therefore be disappointed by the resulting - suboptimal - 3D effect. This presentation describes emotion3D's developments in video processing, which enable 3D film content to be adapted in real-time within consumer electronics devices and convey the same sense of realism as in the cinema."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_djalil_mezaour_ldbs/,"Making insightful business decisions in a corporate environment relies mostly on the data managed in its internal information systems. The availability, reliability and quality of these data can have a significant impact in the efficiency of the internal enterprise processes and tools. Unfortunately, internal available data in use in an enterprise are usually not sufficient to meet the competitiveness challenges. In addition to this, a 360° vision of the business information is missing since most of the used tools do not capture the semantics of business oriented information. Integrating advanced semantic tools and mashing up additional data sources from the LOD cloud for example are straightforward to solve the previous problem. This presentation introduces the Enterprise use case of LOD2 project where these two ideas will be implemented."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_errling_bdeor/,The presentation discusses experiences of harvesting most of the linked data web and RDF web sources and maintaining a tterabyte-scale RDF repository on a scale-out platform. We look into recent advances in RDF databasing and how RDF is becoming enterprise-ready for demanding heterogenous data integration and analytics tasks.
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_blumauer_drswd/,"SKOS is a rising star of the linked data world since it is able to link different visions of a semantic web. Being able to enhance enterprise applications with traditional approaches of knowledge organisation from information sciences, SKOS could become a central building block of a web of data. In our presentation we will show how enterprise information integration and enterprise search applications can benefit from SKOS based thesaurus management in combination with linked data."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_pollock_pollsr/,"What does the 'open' in linked open data mean? How do we share and discover the available linked open data that is out there? In this talk we'll look into both these questions, giving a precise definition of openness (and why it matters), looking at the legal tools available to make data open and finally looking at how the legal and technological come together to facilitate data sharing and reuse -- on the semantic web and elsewhere."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_panel_vc/,"In this forum successful entrepreneurs and VCs will discuss ""How to build a successful relationship between a startups and VCs"". The Venture Capitalist Forum is co-organised by the AVCO (Austrian Venture Capitalist Organisation)."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_panel_sul/,"The issue is of existential importance for every innovative STARTup: Without the right team of people, the best business idea will not work. Excellent, entrepreneurial thinking team workers are essential. Moreover, a start up team needs not only great people, but also the right combination of strengths and qualification. Start ups can attract co-entrepreneurs and employees with a high extent of individual responsibility, freedom of scope as well as opportunities for personal and career development. On the other hand, start ups also have considerable disadvantages in the ‘war for talent’: New businesses can usually not yet offer a prestigious brand, well-balanced work times, high work place security and salaries. Entrepreneurs therefore have to face the urgent questions: What is the foundation of a top-performing start up team? According to what criteria should a start up team be assembled? How can especially talented graduates and young professionals be recruited for a start up business? What are the essentials of team development and human resource management in a start up business?"
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_panel_lod/,"Linked Data, if it were plotted on a hype curve today, may arguably be best placed at the peak of inflated expectations. Like the Semantic Web before it, it is presented as a solution for every imaginable problem. Like the Semantic Web before it, it will most likely be used successfully in specific cases and fail to get uptake in other domains. Is the expenditure on solutions in e-government justified? Are there industries losing out by not looking at Linked Data? In this panel, we will explore where the opporunities for Linked Data technology will be found once it passes through the trough of disillusionment and reaches the slope of enlightenment?"
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_nixon_rfwest/,The consistent evaluation of semantic technologies is critical not only for future scientific progress but also for their widespread industrial adoption. Such evaluation needs to address development quality (correctness or robustness) as well as deployment qualities (interoperability or scalability). The SEALS project has concluded the first Worldwide Campaign for Evaluation of Semantic Technology. In this session we will present the first results from this campaign and announce the second campaign beginning in 2011.
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_dimitrov_utopwc/,"This talk will present a summary of how the OWLIM triplestore has been successfully integrated into the Semantic Web publishing stack powering the BBC‘s 2010 World Cup site, performing OWL reasoning with continuously changing data and handling millions of SPARQL queries per day. A summary of some of the OWLIM features (e.g. high-performance reasoning & retraction, scalable replication cluster, optimised owl:sameAs) -- which make using RDF technology for such a high-profile application scenario feasible -- will beprovided as well."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_hladky_tsn/,"Electronic Media companies face the challenge of heterogynous sources, media formats and information overflow. A key issue is related to connecting “similar things” under the content umbrella and to provide relevant information to the user. Further the companies face more pressure for cost controlling and therefore seek to implement solutions that help to automate as many processes as possible. Under the working title “Semantic Newsroom” Ontos and his service partner Avicomp have started to develop solution for the e-media industry. The track will tackle questions like: • Can LOD bring value to content? • Is there a smart re-use of multimedia content? • Can we organizing and package user-generated content? • Can we link various formats by semantic similarity? • Does semantics facilitate journalist‘s every-day work in any way? The track is based on a use case and will highlight existing solutions and concepts that address the above questions. The track will show how semantic technologies and semantic web services have been used and what lessons have been learned. The conclusion is an outlook which is based on the first feedback from the customer. The outlook is a view into the future work at the customer. We will share the future roadmap of new topics, especially the automated electronic planning system which is dedicated to issues related to knowledge management and information integration."
http://videolectures.net/estc2010_moran_cnloe/,"There are numerous efforts underway to enable the creation of ontologies from English. Some of these are based on natural language and some on controlled natural language (CNL). The main benefit of these efforts is the wider adoption of semantic web technologies. In this discussion, we will explore the benefits of controlled natural language ontologies in detail, discuss the core tenets of a standard and a grammar for CNL ontologies, and see a demonstration of a reference implementation for this standard."
