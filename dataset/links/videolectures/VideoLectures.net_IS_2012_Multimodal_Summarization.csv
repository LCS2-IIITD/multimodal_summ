http://videolectures.net/is2012_milic_frayling_social_media/,"Social media services are complex ecosystems of human and technology where the user engagement and the infrastructure support need to be in balance. Sustainability of social media fundamentally depends on the ability to instigate and maintain the user engagement over time and develop business models that leverage that engagement to support the underlying technology. Thus, it is of paramount importance to develop techniques and metrics to monitor the health of the community and to adopt business models that are effective yet compatible with the users’ expectations and established trust. In this presentation we discuss the design challenges of social media, the tools for network analysis, and the implications of the advertising business models for user privacy."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_milic_media_monitoring/,"Selecting the right social media monitoring (SMM) tool has become a challenging task for organizations as SMM industry has branched out to embrace diverse technologies, data types, and numerous vendors confusing buyers. New tools and services are emerging continually, while already established SMM companies are frequently improving their products with new features and broader data coverage. In this study we provide a comprehensive view of the SMM market, product offerings, and business applications, to assist organizations in choosing and employing the SMM tools to best address their specific business goals."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_stajner_sentiment_analysis/,"This paper addresses the problem of sentiment analysis in an informal setting in multiple domains and in two languages. We explore the influence of using background knowledge in the form of different sentiment lexicons, as well as the influence of various lexical surface features. We show that the improvement resulting from using a two-layer model, sentiment lexicons, surface features and feature scaling is most notable on social media datasets in both English and Spanish. For English, we are also able to demonstrate improvement on the news domain using sentiment lexicons and a large improvement on the social media domain. We also demonstrate that domain-specific lexicons bring comparable performance to generalpurpose lexicons."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_skraba_hub_languages/,"In this paper we extend previous work on document retrieval across multilingual corpora. In this setting it is often assumed that we have a certain alignment given based on which we can learn mapping between spaces. In true multilingual corpora however, we often do not have alignments between all languages. There are hub languages which have alignments with many other languages. We look at the effectiveness of leveraging these alignments to learn maps which may have small or no alignments given. We test several methods and investigate the performance of various approaches on theWikipedia dataset."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_starc_relation_extraction/,"In pattern based relation extraction, patterns that with high precision and recall produce semantically useful relations are preferred. We present a technique similar to n-gram extraction that extracts patterns from large text corpora and calculates statistics, like frequency, minimal token frequency and normalized expectation, which guide to preferred patterns. Patterns have named-instances and/or one variable length gap as arguments. We extracted patterns from a large news corpus and translated them to Cyc relations. We focused on four patterns, which we evaluate by asserting their translated relations to Cyc knowledge base."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_trampus_aggregated_web/,"We present a pipeline for acquiring a clean, continuous, real-time aggregated stream of publically available news articles from web sites across the world. The articles are stripped of the web page chrome and semantically enriched to include e.g. a list of entities appearing in each article. The results are cached and distributed in an efficient manner."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_stopar_news_search/,"NewsSearch proposed in this paper is a search engine interface, which allows users to visually re-rank search results. When a query is first made, the results are visualized using topic, concept and location widgets on the client side. The user is then able to filter and re-rank complete results by interacting with the visualization widgets. Filtering and re-ranking is performed on the server side, allowing the user to seamlessly browse through millions of results."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_glavas_event_factuality/,"There is a certain discrepancy between real-world events and their representations in text (linguistic events or event mentions). The event mentions often refer to future or hypothetical events that have not actually occurred or whose occurrence is uncertain. In this paper we address the problem of predicting event factuality in Croatian texts using supervised machine learning. For each event mention, we aim to predict its polarity (whether the denoted event has actually happened) and its certainty (the level of confidence that the denoted event has happened). We use only lexically-based features, in order to investigate how well this problem may be addressed for a resource-poor language such as Croatian. Our preliminary results suggest that while predicting event polarity using only lexically-based features is feasible, predicting event certainty mandates the use of more sophisticated features."

http://videolectures.net/is2012_stopar_alert_system/,"Large open source projects use several communication channels to exchange information. Examples of these channels are bug tracking systems (BTS), source code management systems, mailing lists, forums and wikis. Since these information sources use different platforms there is no system which would allow users of these communication channels to find information appearing on any of these sources. Developing a system that will support such search functionality is the main goal of a European project called ALERT. In this paper we will introduce the project and describe the search features that can be used by the users of the ALERT system and highlight the advantages that they bring."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_moraru_smart_cities/,"Complex Event Processing (CEP) is emerging as a new paradigm for continuous processing of streaming data in order to detect relevant information and provide support for timely reactions. The main role of a CEP engine is to detect the occurrence of event patterns on the incoming streaming data. However, the problem of discovering the event patterns, although strongly related to the data mining field, has not been studied from the perspective of CEP applications. This paper presents the first steps towards defining a framework that would allow seamless integration of CEP and data mining method. We present the smart cities scenarios as a good working-field for experimentation. A concrete use case is discussed and preliminary results are presented for real-live data that has been collected."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_pogacnik_photo_aesthetics/,"In this paper we propose a method for automatic assessment of aesthetic appeal of photographs. We identify significant parameters that distinguish high quality photography from low quality snapshots. On the basis of these parameters, we defined calculable features for automatic assessment of photography aesthetics using machine learning methods. The calculation of features depends heavily on the identification of the subject in photographs. With the subject identified, we defined and implemented various features to analyze various aspects of a photograph. The features were tested on two datasets. First dataset was obtained from Flickr and manually labeled for evaluation. Second dataset was based on photographs from DPChallenge portal where subjects were identied with a face detection algorithm. Both experiments showed some promising results. In this article we specify the features which contribute to a successful classication of photographs, analyze their in influence and discuss the results. In conclusion, we offer some suggestions for further research."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_bratko_ai_slovenia/,"Today there are at least ten research laboratories in Slovenia that can be counted as being importantly involved with Artificial Intelligence research, with solid funding that comes mainly from the Slovenian and EU research programs and projects. There are about 150 researchers involved in this research. In this talk I will describe how all this started about four decades ago with a few researchers, and how it developed into the present, rather sizable Slovenian AI community. I will tell some memorable stories, largely from my own personal perspective, of exciting research ideas and scientific achievements in the process. I will also describe the immense benefit that Slovenian AI enjoyed from the collaboration with Donald Michie, one of the pioneers of AI and a co-worker of Alan Turing during the 2nd World War, and other excellent researchers, including Claude Sammut and Stephen Muggleton, who once worked at Donald’s research institutions Edinburgh University and Turing Institute in Glasgow."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_muggleton_ai_developement/,"During the centennial year of his birth Alan Turing (1912-1954) has been widely celebrated as having laid the foundations for Computer Science, Automated Decryption, Systems Biology and the Turing Test. In this talk we investigate Turing's motivations and expectations for the development of Machine Intelligence, as expressed in his 1950 article in Mind. We show that many of the trends and developments within AI over the last 50 years were foreseen in this foundational paper. In particular, Turing not only describes the use of Computational Logic but also the necessity for the development of Machine Learning in order to achieve human-level AI within a 50 year time-frame. His description of the Child Machine (a machine which learns like an infant) dominates the closing section of the paper, in which he provides suggestions for how AI might be achieved. Turing discusses three alternative suggestions which can be characterised as: 1) AI by programming, 2) AI by ab initio machine learning and 3) AI using logic, probabilities, learning and background knowledge. He argues that there are inevitable limitations in the first two approaches and recommends the third as the most promising. We compare Turing's three alternatives to developments within AI, and conclude with a discussion of some of the unresolved challenges he posed within the paper."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_milic_frayling_human_factors/,"Encoding data and computation in the digital form has enabled us to extend our capability to process information at rates and scales never possible before. However, the digital medium carries inherent risks and poses grand challenges. First, ensuring a long-term and reliable access to digital assets is of paramount importance. Yet, we are still grappling with the meaning of preservation in the face of tight dependences and dynamic nature of the computing ecosystem. Second, interaction of humans and technologies has been fundamentally deficient. Humans cannot consume nor act on digital directly. It requires software to mediate the interaction. Furthermore, the contemporary computing systems are complex and inaccessible to average users. At the same time, the computer interaction models are insufficient to leverage intelligent feedback of an average user. In this presentation we discuss these issues in detail and consider the approaches to address them."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_bifet_mining_data/,"Streaming data analysis in real time is becoming the fastest and most efficient way to obtain useful knowledge from what is happening now, allowing organizations to react quickly when problems appear or to detect new trends helping to improve their performance. Evolving data streams are contributing to the growth of data created over the last few years. We are creating the same quantity of data every two days, as we created from the dawn of time up until 2003. Evolving data streams methods are becoming a low-cost, green methodology for real time online prediction and analysis. We discuss the current and future trends of mining evolving data streams, and the challenges that the field will have to overcome during the next years."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_sammut_child_machine/,"I think of machine learning research as building two different types of entities: Turing’s Child Machine and H.G. Wells’ World Brain. The former is a machine that learns incrementally by receiving instruction from a trainer or by its own trial-and-error. The latter is a permanent repository that makes all human knowledge accessible to anyone in the world. While machine learning began following the Child Machine model, recent research has been more focussed on “organising the world’s information”. Both are important endeavours, however, incremental learning has been neglected and, we argue, should be revived."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_gama_ubiquitous_environments/,"In the data stream computational model examples are processed once, using restricted computational resources and storage capabilities. The goal of data stream mining consists of learning a decision model, under these constraints, from sequences of observations generated from environments with unknown dynamics. Most of the stream mining works focus on centralized approaches. The phenomenal growth of mobile and embedded devices coupled with their ever-increasing computational and communications capacity presents exciting new opportunities for real-time, distributed intelligent data analysis in ubiquitous environments. In domains like sensor networks, smart grids, social cars, ambient intelligence, etc. centralized approaches have limitations due to communication constraints, power consumption, and privacy concerns. Distributed online algorithms are highly needed to address the above concerns. The focus of this presentation is on distributed stream clustering algorithms that are highly scalable, computationally efficient and resource-aware. These features enable the continued operation of data stream mining algorithms in highly dynamic mobile and ubiquitous environments."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_gams_science_einstein/,"Achievements of Alan Mathison Turing (AMT) in computer science and informatics resemble those of Albert Einstein in physics. Turing’s contributions are presented through most important events and achievements, and in particular through the concept of hypercomputers. Several AI and human-intelligence related concepts are analyzed. A short text is devoted to Donald Michie, Turing's co-worker and contemporary, an honorary member of the Jozef Stefan Institute. Even though his centenary, Turing remains largely unknown to an average citizen of the world. An appeal for his full recognition is proposed."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_mladenic_grobelnik_text_data/,"Text is one of the traditional ways of communication between people. With the growing availability of text data in electronic form, handling and analysis of text by means of computers gained popularity. Handling text data with machine learning methods brought interesting challenges to the area that got further extended by incorporation of some natural language specifics. As the methods were capable of addressing more complex problems related to text data, the expectations got bigger calling for a combination of methods from different research areas including information retrieval, machine learning, statistical data analysis, data mining, natural language processing, semantic technologies. Nowadays automatic text analysis is an integral part of many systems, pushing boundaries of research capabilities towards artificial intelligence dream on never ending learning from text aiming at mimicking ways of human learning. The paper presents development of text analysis research in Slovenian that we have been personally involved in, pointing out interesting research problems that have been and are still addressed by the research, example tasks that have been addressed and some challenges on the way."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_kralj_novak_biomedical_research/,"The paper first outlines subgroup discovery and selected relational data mining approaches, with the emphasis on propositionalization and relational subgroup discovery, which prove to be effective for data analysis in biomedical applications. The core of this paper describes recently developed approaches to semantic data mining which enable the use of domain ontologies as background knowledge in data analysis. The use of described techniques and tools is illustrated on selected biomedical applications."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_bohanec_dex_methodology/,"DEX is a qualitative multi-attribute decision modeling methodology, which is based on an integration of multicriteria decision modeling with rule-based expert systems. The method was conceived 33 years ago. In its lifespan, it has been implemented in a wide range of computer programs that have been used in hundreds of practical applications. In this paper we report on its main methodological concepts, contributions to the theory and practice of decision support, and present a history of its development and evolution."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_dzeroski_biosciences/,"The above title currently provides the best single label for the topics covered by my research group. Here I provide a brief summary of our current research and some of the research directions we intend to pursue. Systems biosciences study biological systems in a holistic manner, focusing on the interactions among system components rather than the components themselves. Large amounts of data of increasing complexity are generated in these sciences (which include systems ecology and systems biology): The use of machine learning to make sense of these data is thus a necessity. We discuss two machine learning tasks that appear in this context, predicting structured outputs and automated modeling of dynamic systems. We describe some techniques for solving these tasks and some example application of these techniques in systems ecology and systems biology."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_pevec_individual_predictions/,"We review some recent research topics by Laboratory for Cognitive Modeling (LKM) at Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. Classification and regression models, either automatically generated from data by machine learning algorithms, or manually encoded with the help of domain experts, are daily used to predict the labels of new instances. Each such individual prediction, in order to be accepted/trusted by users, should be accompanied by an explanation of the prediction as well as by an estimate of its reliability. In LKM we have recently developed a general methodology for explaining individual predictions as well as for estimating their reliability. Both, explanation and reliability estimation are general techniques, independent of the underlying model and provide on-line (effective and efficient) support to the users of prediction models."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_demsar_orange/,"Orange (http://orange.biolab.si) is a general-purpose machine learning and data mining tool. It features a multilayer architecture suitable for different kinds of users, from inexperienced data mining beginners to programmers who prefer to access the tool through its scripting interface. In the paper we outline the history of Orange's development and present its current state, achievements and the future  challenges."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_przepiorkowski_polish_language/,"The talk gives an overview of Polish linguistic resources and tools (LRTs): corpora, lexica (including two wordnets), morphological analysers, taggers, grammars and parsers, etc. It will focus on recent work on multilingual LRTs, including parallel corpora, especially on work carried out at the Polish Academy of Sciences on grammar induction from such parallel corpora."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_tadic_cesar/,"The talk gives an overview of the results achieved so far within the ICT-PSP project CESAR. The new or enhanced/enlarged language resources, tools and services were/are made accessible in three batches, so we will briefly describe their contents. The project includes partners from six Central and Southeast European countries and their respective languages while it operates as an integral part of META-NET Europe-wide initiative."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_krizaj_visual_system/,"In many, perhaps most, vertebrate species, vision represents a dominant sensory modality that is essential for orientation and communication with the outside world. An animal’s ability to perceive the external world is conditioned by its capacity to extract and encode specific features of the visual image. Thus, the output of the vertebrate retina is not a simple representation of the 2D visual map generated by photon absorptions in the photoreceptor layer but rather is transmitted as an abstract representation that emphasizes species-specific behavioral needs. The lecture will lead us through the complex path of the visual stimuli on its way from a simple electromagnetic signal to formation of a visual representation. The recently discovered retinal mechanosensitive ion channels will be used as an example through which molecular physiology could unify Greek phenomenology, modern neuroscience and medicine."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_pirtosek_visual_brain/,"Apart from having big brain primates are also distinctly visual animals. For better visual perception the eyes of the mammals project forwards thus enabling binocular vision, two physiologically distinct pathways, (parvocellular attending to the detail and colour, and magnocellular involved in movement) within the layered subcortical lateral geniculate nucleus, an excellent binocular integration, and high visual acuity have developed and, later in evolution, higher nonV1 visual regions have emerged with a numerous cortical regions interacting in a complex arrangement of progressively more elaborate and more focused analysis of visual information. Relatively recently, in early Paleolithic, these hierarchically organized visual cortices start interacting with the now mature prefrontal cortex and - while remaining predominantly visual - Homo sapiens sapiens was now able to fully express his human creativity, arts, symbolism, religion, science and plan more coherent and formally organized social life."
http://videolectures.net/is2012_friedrich_monitoring_areas/,"In disaster situation a quickly obtained and regularly updated overview image of an area provides essential information for the rescue mission planning. Such an overview image can be composed from the individual pictures taken by a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, currently drones are remotely controlled by humans during such missions. To the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted on the problem of UAV routing for such task. Therefore, we propose a method based on the well-known metaheuristic Variable Neighborhood Search. In particular, we developed two new heuristics to construct the initial solution and an additional neighborhood operator. Computational experiments indicate that solutions obtained by our metaheuristic do not exceed the optimum by more than 26.9\% on small scenarios. For the large instances with hundreds of points (where no optimal solution is known) the proposed method constructs feasible solutions in less than one second."
