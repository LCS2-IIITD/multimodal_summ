http://videolectures.net/colt2015_roughgarden_game_theory/,"Algorithmic game theory is a field that uses and extends tools from economics and game theory to reason about fundamental computer science problems. The field is important both for its applications, which span the gamut from network routing to online advertising, and for its remarkably diverse and rich connections to other areas of theoretical computer science, including complexity theory and approximation algorithms. In this talk, we survey two ways in which definitions and tools from learning theory have been crucial to recent advances in algorithmic game theory. First, we outline a theory of robust bounds on the ""price of anarchy"" --- meaning approximation guarantees for game-theoretic equilibria --- that apply to all outcome sequences generated by no-regret learners playing a multi-player game. Second, we explain how to use concepts from learning theory to make traditional (Bayesian) optimal auction theory operational, replacing the practically problematic ""common prior"" assumption with a data-driven approach."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_spielman_laplacian_matrices/,"The Laplacian matrices of graphs arise in many fields including Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Optimization, Computational Science, and of course Network Analysis.  We will explain what these matrices are and why they arise in so many applications.  We then will survey recent progress on the design of algorithms that allow us to solve such systems of linear equations in nearly linear time. In particular, we will show how fast algorithms for graph sparsification directly lead to fast Laplacian system solvers.  As an application, we will explain how Laplacian system solvers can be used to quickly solve linear programs arising from natural graph problems."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_villani_ricci_curvature/,"This is the story of a mathematical theory which was born from the encounter of several fields. Those fields were: Riemannian geometry, gradient flows, information, and optimal transport; and their encounter took place about 15 years ago. A major result of the interaction was the synthetic theory of Ricci curvature bounds, which was formalized around 2005 and now seems to be reaching maturity, after ten years of fast, sustained growth. As the theory is still in rapid evolution, it is often difficult, even for experts, to trace its progress accurately."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_simon_pac_algorithm/,"The best currently known general lower and upper bounds on the number of labeled examples needed for learning a concept class in the PAC framework (the realizable case) do not perfectly match: they leave a gap of order $\log(1/\eps)$ (resp.a gap which is logarithmic in another one of the relevant parameters). It is an unresolved question whether there exists an ``optimal PAC algorithm'' which establishes a general upper bound with precisely the same order of magnitude as the general lower bound. According to a result of Auer and Ortner, there is no way for showing that arbitrary consistent algorithms are optimal because they can provably differ from optimality by factor $\log(1/\eps)$. In contrast to this result, we show that every consistent algorithm $L$ (even a provably suboptimal one) induces a family $(L_K)_{K\ge1}$ of PAC algorithms (with $2K-1$ calls of $L$ as a subroutine) which come very close to optimality: the number of labeled examples needed by $L_K$ exceeds the general lower bound only by factor $\ell_K(1/\eps)$ where $\ell_K$ denotes (a truncated version of) the $K$-times iterated logarithm. Moreover, $L_K$ is applicable to any concept class $C$ of finite VC-dimension and it can be implemented efficiently whenever the consistency problem for $C$ is feasible. We show furthermore that, for every consistent algorithm $L$, $L_2$ is an optimal PAC algorithm for precisely the same concept classes which were used by Auer and Ortner for showing the existence of suboptimal consistent algorithms. This can be seen as an indication that $L_K$ may have an even better performance than it is suggested by our worstcase analysis."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_papadimitriou_learning_prediction/,"What is the mechanism of learning in the brain? Despite breathtaking advances in neuroscience, we do not seem close to an answer. We introduce PJOIN (for “predictive join”), a primitive that com- bines and extends the operations of JOIN and LINK that are the basis of Valiant’s computational theory of cortex. We show that PJOIN can be implemented naturally in Valiant’s neuroidal model, a conservative formal model of cortical computation. Using PJOIN — and almost nothing else — we give a simple algorithm for unsupervised learning of arbitrary ensembles of binary patterns. This algorithm relies crucially on prediction, and entails significant downward traffic (“feedback”) while parsing stimuli. Prediction and feedback are well-known features of neural cognition and, as far as we know, this is the first theoretical prediction of their essential role in learning."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_shamir_complexity_learning/,"A well-recognized limitation of kernel learning is the requirement to handle a kernel matrix, whose size is quadratic in the number of training examples. Many methods have been proposed to reduce this computational cost, mostly by using a subset of the kernel matrix entries, or some form of low-rank matrix approximation, or a random projection method. In this paper, we study lower bounds on the error attainable by such methods as a function of the number of entries observed in the kernel matrix or the rank of an approximate kernel matrix. We show that there are kernel learning problems where no such method will lead to non-trivial computational savings. Our results also quantify how the problem difficulty depends on parameters such as the nature of the loss function, the regularization parameter, the norm of the desired predictor, and the kernel matrix rank. Our results also suggest cases where more efficient kernel learning might be possible."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_huang_tensor_decomposition/,"We analyze stochastic gradient descent for optimizing non-convex functions. For non-convex functions often it is good to find a reasonable local minimum, and the main concern is that gradient updates are trapped in saddle points. In this paper we identify strict saddle property for non-convex problem that allows for efficient optimization, and show that stochastic gradient descent converges to a local minimum in a polynomial number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that gives global convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent on non-convex functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points. Our analysis can be applied to orthogonal tensor decomposition, which is widely used in learning a rich class of latent variable models. We propose a new optimization formulation for the tensor decomposition problem that has strict saddle property. As a result we get the first online algorithm for orthogonal tensor decomposition with convergence guarantee."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_kyng_sample_complexity/,"We present a simple, general technique for reducing the sample complexity of matrix and tensor decomposition algorithms applied to distributions. We use the technique to give a polynomial-time algorithm for standard ICA with sample complexity nearly linear in the dimension, thereby improving substantially on previous bounds. The analysis is based on properties of random polynomials, namely the spacings of an ensemble of polynomials. Our technique also applies to other applications of tensor decompositions, including spherical Gaussian mixture models."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_ostrovsky_convex_optimization/,"We present a theoretical framework for adaptive estimation and prediction of signals of unknown structure in the presence of noise. It addresses two intertwined challenges: (i) designing optimal statistical estimators; (ii) designing efficient numerical algorithms. In particular, we establish oracle inequalities for performance of adaptive procedures, which rely upon convex optimization and thus can be efficiently implemented. We illustrate some potential applications of the proposed approach."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_frostig_risk_minimizer/,"Many optimization problems that arise in science and engineering are those in which we only have a stochastic approximation to the underlying objective (e.g. estimation problems such as linear regression). That is, given some distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over functions $\psi$, we wish to minimize $P(x) = \mathbb{E}_{\psi \sim \mathcal{D}}[\psi(x)]$, using as few samples from $\mathcal{D}$ as possible. In the absence of computational constraints, the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) -- the minimizer on a sample average of observed data -- is widely regarded as the estimation strategy of choice due to its desirable statistical convergence properties. Our goal is to do as well as the empirical risk minimizer, on every problem, while minimizing the use of computational resources such as running time and space usage."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_flammarion_averaging_acceleration/,"We show that accelerated gradient descent, averaged gradient descent and the heavy-ball method for non-strongly convex problems may be reformulated as constant parameter second-order difference equation algorithms, where stability of the system is equivalent to convergence at rate O(1/n^2) where n is the number of iterations. We provide a detailed analysis of the eigenvalues of the corresponding linear dynamical system, showing various oscillatory and non-oscillatory behaviors, together with a sharp stability result with explicit constants. We also consider the situation where noisy gradients are available, where we extend our general convergence result, which suggest an alternative algorithm (i.e., with different step sizes) that exhibits the good aspects of both averaging and acceleration."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_luo_adaptive_normalhedge/,"We study the classic online learning problem of predicting with expert advice, and propose a truly parameter-free and adaptive algorithm that achieves several objectives simultaneously without using any prior information. The main component of this work is an improved version of the NormalHedge.DT algorithm (Luo and Schapire, 2014), called AdaNormalHedge. On one hand, this new algorithm ensures small regret when the competitor has small loss and almost constant regret when the losses are stochastic. On the other hand, the algorithm is able to compete with any convex combination of the experts simultaneously, with a regret in terms of the relative entropy of the prior and the competitor. This resolves an open problem proposed by Chaudhuri et al. (2009) and Chernov and Vovk (2010). Moreover, we extend the results to the sleeping expert setting and provide two applications to illustrate the power of AdaNormalHedge: 1) competing with time-varying unknown competitors and 2) predicting almost as well as the best pruning tree. Our results on these applications significantly improve previous work from different aspects, and a special case of the first application resolves another open problem proposed by Warmuth and Koolen (2014) on whether one can simultaneously achieve optimal shifting regret for both adversarial and stochastic losses."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_kuznetsov_path_experts/,We consider two broad families of non-additive loss functions covering a large number of applications: rational losses and tropical losses. We give new algorithms extending the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) algorithm to both of these families of loss functions and similarly give new algorithms extending the Randomized Weighted Majority (RWM) algorithm to both of these families. We prove that the time complexity of our extensions to rational losses of both FPL and RWM is polynomial and present regret bounds for both. We further show that these algorithms can play a critical role in improving performance in applications such as structured prediction.
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_koolen_quantile_methods/,"We aim to design strategies for sequential decision making that adjust to the difficulty of the learning problem. We study this question both in the setting of prediction with expert advice, and for more general combinatorial decision tasks. We are not satisfied with just guaranteeing minimax regret rates, but we want our algorithms to perform significantly better on easy data. Two popular ways to formalize such adaptivity are second-order regret bounds and quantile bounds. The underlying notions of `easy data', which may be paraphrased as ``the learning problem has small variance'' and ``multiple decisions are useful'', are synergetic. But even though there are sophisticated algorithms that exploit one of the two, no existing algorithm is able to adapt to both. In this paper we outline a new method for obtaining such adaptive algorithms, based on a potential function that aggregates a range of learning rates (which are essential tuning parameters). By choosing the right prior we construct efficient algorithms and show that they reap both benefits by proving the first bounds that are both second-order and incorporate quantiles."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_takimoto_online_density/,"We consider an online density estimation problem for Bradley-Terry models which determine the probability of a match result between any pair in the set of $n$ teams. An annoying issue is that the loss function is not convex. A standard solution to avoid the non-convexity is to change variables so that the new loss function w.r.t.new variables is convex. But, then the radius $K$ of the new domain might be huge or infinite in general. When $K$ is regarded as a constant, standard algorithms OGD and ONS have regret bounds $O(n^{\frac{1}{2}}(\ln K)\sqrt{T})$ and $O(n^{\frac{3}{2}}K\ln T)$, respectively."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_sridharan_online_prediction/,"We propose a framework for online prediction with a benchmark defined through an evolving constraint set. We analyze a method based on random playout. While computing the optimal decision in hindsight might be hard due to the combinatorial constraints, we provide polynomial-time prediction algorithms based on Lasserre semidefinite hierarchy. Since the predictions are improper, the algorithm only needs the value of an online relaxation and not the integral solution. We provide a generic regret bound based on the integrality gap of Lasserre hierarchy at level $r$, thus establishing a link between the time required for solving the semidefinite relaxation and the associated regret bound in terms of Rademacher complexity. Our results are applicable for problems involving prediction over evolving graphs with stochastic side information."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_shamir_linear_optimization/,"We study the attainable regret for online linear optimization problems with bandit feedback, where unlike the full-information setting, the player can only observe its own loss rather than the full loss vector. We show that the price of bandit information in this setting can be as large as $d$, disproving the well-known conjecture (\cite{dani2007price}) that the regret for bandit linear optimization is at most $\sqrt{d}$ times the full-information regret. Surprisingly, this is shown using ``trivial'' modifications of standard domains, which have no effect in the full-information setting. This and other results we present highlight some interesting differences between full-information and bandit learning, which were not considered in previous literature."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_koren_one_dimension/,"We analyze the minimax regret of the adversarial bandit convex optimization problem. Focusing on the one-dimensional case, we prove that the minimax regret is $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ and partially resolve a decade-old open problem. Our analysis is non-constructive, as we do not present a concrete algorithm that attains this regret rate. Instead, we use minimax duality to reduce the problem to a Bayesian setting, where the convex loss functions are drawn from a worst-case distribution, and then we solve the Bayesian version of the problem with a variant of Thompson Sampling. Our analysis features a novel use of convexity, formalized as a ``local-to-global'' property of convex functions, that may be of independent interest."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_rigollet_bandit_problems/,"Motivated by practical applications, chiefly clinical trials, we study the regret achievable for stochastic multi-armed bandits under the constraint that the employed policy must split trials into a small number of batches. Our results show that a very small number of batches gives already close to minimax optimal regret bounds and we also evaluate the number of trials in each batch. As a byproduct, we derive optimal policies with low switching cost for stochastic bandits."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_kanade_mcmc_learning/,"The theory of learning under the uniform distribution is rich and deep, with connections to cryptography, computational complexity, and the analysis of boolean functions to name a few areas. This theory however is very limited due to the fact that the uniform distribution and the corresponding Fourier basis are rarely encountered as a statistical model."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_mansour_corrupted_inputs/,"We consider a model where given an uncorrupted input an adversary can corrupt it to one out of $m$ corrupted inputs. We model the classification and inference problems as a zero-sum game between a learner, minimizing the expected error, and an adversary, maximizing the expected error. The value of this game is the optimal error rate achievable. For learning using a limited hypothesis class $\calH$ over corrupted inputs, we give an efficient algorithm that given an uncorrupted sample returns a hypothesis $h\in H$ whose error on adversarially corrupted inputs is near optimal. Our algorithm uses as a blackbox an oracle that solves the ERM problem for the hypothesis class $\calH$. We provide a generalization bound for our setting, showing that for a sufficiently large sample, the performance on the sample and future unseen corrupted inputs will be similar. This gives an efficient learning algorithm for our adversarial setting, based on an ERM oracle. We also consider an inference related setting of the problem, where given a corrupted input, the learner queries the target function on various uncorrupted inputs and generates a prediction regarding the given corrupted input. There is no limitation on the prediction function the learner may generate, so implicitly the hypothesis class includes all possible hypotheses. In this setting we characterize the optimal learner policy as a minimum vertex cover in a given bipartite graph, and the optimal adversary policy as a maximum matching in the same bipartite graph. We design efficient local algorithms for approximating minimum vertex cover in bipartite graphs, which implies an efficient near optimal algorithm for the learner."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_daniely_agnostically_learning/,"We present a PTAS for agnostically learning halfspaces w.r.t. the uniform distribution on the $d$ dimensional sphere. Namely, we show that for every $\mu>0$ there is an algorithm that runs in time $\poly\left(d,\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$, and is guaranteed to return a classifier with error at most $(1+\mu)\opt+\epsilon$, where $\opt$ is the error of the best halfspace classifier. This improves on Awasthi, Balcan and Long who showed an algorithm with an (unspecified) constant approximation ratio. Our algorithm combines the classical technique of polynomial regression (e.g. LMN89, KKMS05), together with the new localization technique of ABL14."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_telgarsky_conditional_probability/,"This manuscript strengthens the link between convex risk minimization and conditional probability estimation, a connection already notable for establishing consistency results (Friedman et al., 2000; Zhang, 2004b; Bartlett et al., 2006). Specifically, this manuscript first shows that a loss function, linear space of predictors, and probability measure together define a unique optimal conditional probability model, moreover one which may be attained by the usual convex risk minimization. This result is proved in infinite dimensions, and thus gives a concrete convergence target for unregularized methods like boosting which can fail to have minimizers. Second, this convergence result is refined in finitely many dimensions to hold for empirical risk minimization. This uniform convergence result exhibits no dependence on the norms of its predictors, and thus can justify the practical effectiveness of minimally-regularized optimization schemes."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_urner_linear_separators/,"We study the learnability of linear separators in $\Re^d$ in the presence of bounded (a.k.a Massart) noise. This is a realistic generalization of the random classification noise model, where the adversary can flip each example $x$ with probability $\eta(x) \leq \eta$. We provide the first polynomial time algorithm that can learn linear separators to arbitrary small excess error in this noise model under the uniform distribution over the unit sphere in $\Re^d$. While widely studied in the statistical learning theory community in the context of getting faster convergence rates, computationally efficient algorithms in this model had remained elusive. Our work provides the first evidence that one can indeed design algorithms achieving arbitrary small excess errors in polynomial time under this realistic noise model and thus opens up a new and exciting line of research. We additionally provide lower bounds showing that popular algorithms such as hinge loss minimization and averaging cannot lead to arbitrary small excess error under Massart noise, even under the uniform distribution. Our work instead, makes use of a margin based technique developed in the context of active learning. As a result, our algorithm is also an active learning algorithm with only a logarithmic dependence in the desired excess error $\epsilon$."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_balsubramani_unlabeled_data/,"We develop a worst-case analysis of aggregation of classifier ensembles for binary classification. The task of predicting to minimize error is formulated as a game played over a given set of unlabeled data (a transductive setting), where prior label information is encoded as constraints on the game. The minimax solution of this game identifies cases where a weighted combination of the classifiers can perform significantly better than any single classifier."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_dasarathy_nonparametric_classification/,"This paper investigates the problem of active learning for binary label prediction on a graph. We introduce a simple and label-efficient algorithm called $S^2$ for this task. At each step, $S^2$ selects the vertex to be labeled based on the structure of the graph and all previously gathered labels. Specifically, $S^2$ queries for the label of the vertex that bisects the {\em shortest shortest} path between any pair of oppositely labeled vertices. We present a theoretical estimate of the number of queries $S^2$ needs in terms of a novel parametrization of the complexity of binary functions on graphs. We also present experimental results demonstrating the performance of $S^2$ on both real and synthetic data. While other graph-based active learning algorithms have shown promise in practice, our algorithm is the first with both good performance and theoretical guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of the $S^2$ algorithm to the theory of nonparametric active learning. In particular, we show that $S^2$ achieves near minimax optimal excess risk for an important class of nonparametric classification problems."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_kpotufe_data_dependent_partitions/,"Given a joint distribution $P_{X, Y}$ over a space $\X$ and a label set $\Y=\braces{0, 1}$, we consider the problem of recovering the labels of an unlabeled sample with as few label queries as possible. Recovered labels can be passed to a passive learner, thus turning the procedure into an active learning approach. We analyze a family of labeling procedures based on a hierarchical clustering of the data. While such labeling procedures have been studied in the past, we provide a new parametrization of $P_{X, Y}$ that captures their behavior in general low-noise settings, and which accounts for data-dependent clustering, thus providing new theoretical underpinning to practically used tools."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_eldridge_hierarchical_clustering/,"Hierarchical clustering is a popular method for analyzing data, which associates a tree to a dataset. Hartigan consistency has been used extensively as a framework to analyze such clustering algorithms from a statistical point of view. Still, as we show in the paper, a tree which is Hartigan consistent with a given density can look very different than the correct limit tree. Specifically, Hartigan consistency permits two types of undesirable configurations which we term over-segmentation and {\it improper nesting}. Moreover, Hartigan consistency is a limit property and does not directly quantify difference between trees. In this paper we identify two limit properties, separation and minimality, which address both over-segmentation and improper nesting and together imply (but are not implied by) Hartigan consistency. We proceed to introduce a merge distortion distance between hierarchical clusterings and show that convergence in that distance implies both separation and minimality. We also show that uniform separation and minimality imply convergence in the merge distortion distance. Furthermore, we show that our merge distortion distance is stable under perturbations of the density. Finally, we demonstrate applicability of these concepts by proving convergence results for two clustering algorithms. First, we show convergence (and hence separation and minimality) of the recent robust single linkage algorithm of Chaudhuri and Dasgupta (2010). Second, we provide convergence results on manifolds for topological split tree clustering."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_ma_sparse_coding/,"Sparse coding is a basic task in many fields including signal processing, neuroscience and machine learning where the goal is to learn a basis that enables a sparse representation of a given set of data, if one exists. Its standard formulation is as a non-convex optimization problem which is solved in practice by heuristics based on alternating minimization. Recent work has resulted in several algorithms for sparse coding with provable guarantees, but somewhat surprisingly these are outperformed by the simple alternating minimization heuristics. Here we give a general framework for understanding alternating minimization which we leverage to analyze existing heuristics and to design new ones also with provable guarantees. Some of these algorithms seem implementable on simple neural architectures, which was the original motivation of Olshausen and Field \cite{OF} in introducing sparse coding. We also give the first efficient algorithm for sparse coding that works almost up to the information theoretic limit for sparse recovery on incoherent dictionaries. All previous algorithms that approached or surpassed this limit run in time exponential in some natural parameter. Finally, our algorithms improve upon the sample complexity of existing approaches. We believe that our analysis framework will have applications in other settings where simple iterative algorithms are used."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_steurer_component_analysis/,"We study a statistical model for the \emph{tensor principal component analysis problem} introduced by Montanari and Richard: Given a order-$3$ tensor $\bT$ of the form $\bT = \tau \cdot v_0^{\tensor 3} + \bA$, where $\tau \geq 0$ is a signal-to-noise ratio, $v_0$ is a unit vector, and $\bA$ is a random noise tensor, the goal is to recover the planted vector $v_0$. For the case that $\bA$ has iid standard Gaussian entries, we give an efficient algorithm to recover $v_0$ whenever $\tau \gg n^{3/4} \log(n)^{1/4}$, and certify that the recovered vector is close to a maximum likelihood estimator, all with high probability over the random choice of $\bA$. The previous best algorithms with provable guarantees required $\tau \geq \Omega(n)$. In the regime $\tau \ll n$, natural tensor-unfolding-based spectral relaxations for the underlying optimization problem break down. To go beyond this barrier, we use convex relaxations based on the sum-of-squares method. Indeed our recovery algorithm proceeds by rounding a degree-$4$ sum-of-squares relaxations of the maximum-likelihood-estimation problem for the statistical model. To complement our algorithmic results, we show that degree-$4$ sum-of-squares relaxations break down for $\tau \ll n^{3/4}$, which demonstrates that improving our current guarantees (by more than logarithmic factors) would require new techniques or might even be intractable. Finally, we show how to exploit additional problem structure in order to solve our sum-of-squares relaxations, up to some approximation, very efficiently. Our fastest algorithm runs in nearly-linear time using shifted (matrix) power iteration and has similar guarantees as above. The analysis of this algorithm also confirms a conjecture of Montanari and Richard about singular vectors of tensor unfoldings."

We show that, for a wide class of well-clustered graphs, spectral clustering algorithms can give a good approximation of the optimal clustering. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first theoretical analysis of spectral clustering algorithms for a wide family of graphs, even though such approach was proposed in the early 1990s and has comprehensive applications. We also give a nearly-linear time algorithm for partitioning well-clustered graphs, which is based on heat kernel embeddings and approximate nearest neighbor data structures."

The goal of online PCA is to simultaneously minimize the target dimension $\ell$ and the error $\|X - (XY^\pinv)Y\|^2$. We describe two simple and deterministic algorithms. The first, receives a parameter $\Delta$ and guaranties that $\|X - (XY^\pinv)Y\|^2$ is not significantly larger than $\Delta$. It requires a target dimension of $\ell = O(k/\eps)$ for any $k,\eps$ such that $\Delta \ge \eps\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_{k+1}^2$. The second receives $k$ and $\eps$ and guaranties that $\|X - (XY^\pinv)Y\|^2 \le \eps\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_{k+1}^2$. It requires a target dimension of $O( k\log n/\eps^2)$.

This gives the first explicit construction of a universal barrier for convex bodies with optimal self-concordance parameter. The proof is based on basic geometry of log-concave distributions, and elementary duality in exponential families.

The problem is reduced to sampling from an \emph{approximately} log-concave distribution using the Hit-and-Run method, with query complexity of $\mathcal{O}^*(n^{4.5})$. In the context of zeroth order stochastic convex optimization, the proposed method produces an $\epsilon$-minimizer after $\mathcal{O}^*(n^{7.5}\epsilon^{-2})$ noisy function evaluations by inducing a $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon/n)$-approximately log concave distribution. We also consider the case when the ``amount of non-convexity'' can be large away from the minimum but decays towards the optimum of the function. Other applications of the random walk method include private computation of empirical risk minimizers, two-stage stochastic programming, and approximate dynamic programming for online learning."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_deshpande_submatrix_problems/,"Given a large data matrix $A\in\reals^{n\times n}$, we consider the problem of determining whether its entries are i.i.d. with some known marginal distribution $A_{ij}\sim P_0$, or instead $A$ contains a principal submatrix $A_{\sC,\sC}$ whose entries have marginal distribution $A_{ij}\sim P_1\neq P_0$. As a special case, the hidden (or planted) clique problem is finding a planted clique in an otherwise uniformly random graph. Assuming unbounded computational resources, this hypothesis testing problem is statistically solvable provided $|\sC|\ge C \log n$ for a suitable constant $C$. However, despite substantial effort, no polynomial time algorithm is known that succeeds with high probability when $|\sC| = o(\sqrt{n})$. Recently, \cite{meka2013association} proposed a method to establish lower bounds for the hidden clique problem within the Sum of Squares (SOS) semidefinite hierarchy. Here we consider the degree-$4$ SOS relaxation, and study the construction of \cite{meka2013association} to prove that SOS fails unless $k\ge C\, n^{1/3}/\log n$. An argument presented by \cite{BarakLectureNotes} implies that this lower bound cannot be substantially improved unless the witness construction is changed in the proof. Our proof uses the moment method to bound the spectrum of a certain random association scheme, i.e. a symmetric random matrix whose rows and columns are indexed by the edges of an Erd\""os-Renyi random graph."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_chen_information_maximization/,"Optimal information gathering is a central challenge in machine learning and science in general. A common objective that quantifies the usefulness of observations is Shannon's mutual information, defined w.r.t. a probabilistic model. Greedily selecting observations that maximize the mutual information is the method of choice in numerous applications, ranging from Bayesian experimental design to automated diagnosis, to active learning in Bayesian models. Despite its importance and widespread use in applications, little is known about the theoretical properties of sequential information maximization, in particular under noisy observations. In this paper, we analyze the widely used greedy policy for this task, and identify problem instances where it provides provably near-maximal utility, even in the challenging setting of persistent noise. Our results depend on a natural separability condition associated with a channel injecting noise into the observations. We also show that this separability condition is necessary: If it does not hold, the greedy policy can fail to select informative observations."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_lafond_family_noise/,"The matrix completion problem consists in reconstructing a matrix from a sample of entries observed with noise. A popular class of estimator, known as nuclear norm penalized estimators, are based on minimizing the sum of a data fitting term and a nuclear norm penalization. Here, we investigate the case where the noise distribution belongs to the exponential family, is sub-exponential and consider a general sampling scheme. We first consider an estimator defined as the minimizer of the sum of a log-likelihood term and a nuclear norm penalization and prove an upper bound on the Frobenius prediction risk. The rate obtained improves on previous works on exponential family completion. When the sampling distribution is known, we propose a second estimator and prove an oracle inequality on the Kullback-Leibler divergence risk, which translates immediatly into an upper bound on the Frobenius risk. Finally, we show that all the rates obtained are minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_netrapalli_finite_samples/,"Matrix completion is the problem of recovering a low rank matrix by observing a small fraction of its entries. A series of recent works \citep{Keshavan2012,JainNS2013,Hardt2013} have proposed fast non-convex optimization based iterative algorithms to solve this problem. However, the sample complexity in all these results is sub-optimal in its dependence on the rank, condition number and the desired accuracy. In this paper, we present a fast iterative algorithm that solves the matrix completion problem by observing $\order{nr^5 \log^3 n}$ entries, which is independent of the condition number and the desired accuracy. The run time of our algorithm is $\order{nr^7\log^3 n\log 1/\epsilon}$ which is near linear in the dimension of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first near linear time algorithm for exact matrix completion with finite sample complexity (i.e. independent of $\epsilon$). Our algorithm is based on a well known projected gradient descent method, where the projection is onto the (non-convex) set of low rank matrices. There are two key ideas in our result: 1) our argument is based on a $\ell_\infty$ norm potential function (as opposed to the spectral norm) and provides a novel way to obtain perturbation bounds for it. 2) we prove and use a natural extension of the Davis-Kahan theorem to obtain perturbation bounds on the best low rank approximation of matrices with good eigen-gap. Both of these ideas may be of independent interest."

In special cases like the Aggregating Algorithm (Vovk (1995)) with mixable losses and the Weighted Average Algorithm (Kivinen and Warmuth (1999)) with exp-concave losses, it is possible to achieve O(1) regret bounds. van Erven (2012) has argued that mixability and exp-concavity are roughly equivalent under certain conditions. Thus by understanding the underlying relationship between these two notions we can gain the best of both algorithms (strong theoretical performance guarantees of the Aggregating Algorithm and the computational efficiency of the Weighted Average Algorithm). In this paper we provide a complete characterization of the exp-concavity of any proper composite loss. Using this characterization and the mixability condition of proper losses (Van Erven et al.

Exploiting the connection of such elicitation to convex analysis, we address the vector-valued property case, which has received relatively little attention in the literature despite its applications to both machine learning and statistics. We first provide a very general characterization of linear and ratio-of-linear properties, the first of which resolves an open problem by unifying and strengthening several previous characterizations in machine learning and statistics. We then ask which vectors of properties admit nonseparable scores, which cannot be expressed as a sum of scores for each coordinate separately, a natural desideratum for machine learning. We show that linear and ratio-of-linear do admit nonseparable scores, and provide evidence for the conjecture that these are the only such properties (up to link functions).

In doing so we introduce a more general notion of $\Phi$-mixability where $\Phi$ is a general entropy (\ie, any convex function on probabilities). We show how a property shared by the convex dual of any such entropy yields a natural algorithm (the minimizer of a regret bound) which, analogous to the classical Aggregating Algorithm, is guaranteed a constant regret when used with $\Phi$-mixable losses. We characterize which $\Phi$ have non-trivial $\Phi$-mixable losses and relate $\Phi$-mixability and its associated Aggregating Algorithm to potential-based methods, a Blackwell-like condition, mirror descent, and risk measures from finance. We also define a notion of ``dominance'' between different entropies in terms of bounds they guarantee and conjecture that classical mixability gives optimal bounds, for which we provide some supporting empirical evidence."

In this framework the algorithm is shown a pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of n items. The learner then predicts a label for each item, from a label set of size L and receives a real valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting scenarios such as collaborative ﬁltering, online gambling, and online max cut among others. Christiano (2014a) designed an efﬁcient online learning algorithm for this problem achieving a regret of O(\sqrt{nL^3T}), where T is the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of O(\sqrt{n log LT}). One of the main open questions left in this framework concerns closing the above gap. In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main results. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-deﬁnite programming based algorithm of Christiano (2014a), in fact achieves a regret of O(\sqrt{n L T}). Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely, we show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower regret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem in regimes widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a related conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike planted clique, the dense subgraph version does not have quasi-polynomial time algorithms. Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we hope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other online learning scenarios as well."

Although extensive studies have proved consistency and asymptotic normality for the empirical version of the STDF, non-asymptotic bounds are still missing. The main purpose of this paper is to fill this gap. Taking advantage of adapted VC-type concentration inequalities, upper bounds are derived with expected rate of convergence in $O(k^{-1/2})$.

In the semi-supervised setting, we exploit label information to get a rough estimate of the model parameters, and then refine it using the tensor method on unlabeled samples. We establish learning guarantees when the number of components scales as $k=o(d^{p/2})$, where $d$ is the observed dimension, and $p$ is the order of the observed moment employed in the tensor method (usually $p=3,4$).

Drawing on the connection between Gaussian graphical models and the recent breakthroughs in spectral graph theory, we give the first nearly linear time algorithm for the following basic matrix problem: Given an n-by-n Laplacian matrix M and a constant -1<= p <= 1, provide efficient access to a sparse n-by-n linear operator C such that M^p \approx C C^T, where \approx denotes spectral similarity. When p is set to -1, this gives the first parallel sampling algorithm that is essentially optimal both in total work and randomness for Gaussian random fields with symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) precision matrices. It only requires nearly linear work and 2n i.i.d. random univariate Gaussian samples to generate an n-dimensional i.i.d. Gaussian random sample in polylogarithmic depth. The key ingredient of our approach is an integration of spectral sparsification with multilevel method: Our algorithms are based on factoring M^p into a product of well-conditioned matrices, then introducing powers and replacing dense matrices with sparse approximations. We give two sparsification methods for this approach that may be of independent interest. The first invokes Maclaurin series on the factors, while the second builds on our new nearly linear time spectral sparsification algorithm for random-walk matrix polynomials. We expect these algorithmic advances will also help to strengthen the connection between machine learning and spectral graph theory, two of the most active fields in understanding large data and networks."

The aim is to minimize the regret with respect to linear predictions. For a variety of constraints on the adversary's labels, we show that the minimax optimal strategy is linear, with a parameter choice that is reminiscent of ordinary least squares (and as easy to compute). The predictions depend on all covariates, past and future, with a particular weighting assigned to future covariates corresponding to the role that they play in the minimax regret. We study two families of label sequences: box constraints (under a covariate compatibility condition), and a weighted 2-norm constraint that emerges naturally from the analysis. The strategy is adaptive in the sense that it requires no knowledge of the constraint set. We obtain an explicit expression for the minimax regret for these games. For the case of uniform box constraints, we show that, with worst case covariate sequences, the regret is $O(d\log T)$, with no dependence on the scaling of the covariates."

Specifically, we show that any feedback graph belongs to one of three classes: \emph{strongly observable} graphs, \emph{weakly observable} graphs, and \emph{unobservable} graphs. We prove that the first class induces learning problems with $\widetilde\Theta(\alpha^{1/2} T^{1/2})$ minimax regret, where $\alpha$ is the independence number of the underlying graph; the second class induces problems with $\widetilde\Theta(\delta^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ minimax regret, where $\delta$ is the domination number of a certain portion of the graph; and the third class induces problems with linear minimax regret.

Here, we propose a new and natural solution concept, rooted in game theory, called a von Neumann winner, a randomized policy that beats or ties every other policy. We show that this notion overcomes important limitations of existing solutions, particularly the Condorcet winner which has typically been used in the past, but which requires strong and often unrealistic assumptions. We then present three efficient algorithms for online learning in our setting, and for approximating a von Neumann winner from batch-like data. The first of these algorithms achieves particularly low regret, even when data is adversarial, although its time and space requirements are linear in the size of the policy space.

This is true even under the promise that there is an unknown k-sparse vector x^* satisfying B x^* = y.

http://videolectures.net/colt2015_thrampoulidis_estimation_error/,"Non-smooth regularized convex optimization procedures have emerged as a powerful tool to recover structured signals (sparse, low-rank, etc.) from (possibly compressed) noisy linear measurements. We focus on the problem of linear regression and consider a general class of optimization methods that minimize a loss function measuring the misfit of the model to the observations with an added “structured-inducing” regularization term. Celebrated instances include the LASSO, Group-LASSO, Least-Absolute Deviations method, etc.. We develop a quite general framework for how to determine precise prediction performance guaranties (e.g. mean-square-error) of such methods for the case of Gaussian measurement ensemble. The machinery builds upon Gordon's Gaussian min-max theorem under additional convexity assumptions that arise in many practical applications. This theorem associates with a primary optimization (PO) problem a simplified auxiliary optimization (AO) problem from which we can tightly infer properties of the original (PO), such as the optimal cost, the norm of the optimal solution, etc. Our theory applies to general loss functions and regularization and provides guidelines on how to optimally tune the regularizer coefficient when certain structural properties (such as sparsity level, rank, etc.) are known."
http://videolectures.net/colt2015_cummings_linear_regression/,"We consider the problem of fitting a linear model to data held by individuals who are concerned about their privacy. Incentivizing most players to report their data to the analyst truthfully constrains our design to mechanisms that provide a privacy guarantee to the participants; we use differentially privacy to model individuals' privacy losses. This immediately poses a problem, as differentially private computation of a linear model necessarily produces a biased estimation, and existing approaches to design mechanisms to elicit data from privacy-sensitive individuals do not generalize well to biased estimators. We manage to overcome this this challenge, through appropriate design of the computation and payment scheme."

http://videolectures.net/colt2014_mansour_implementing/,"The “wisdom of the crowds” has become a hot topic in the last decade with the rapid adaptation of the Internet. At the core of the phenomena is that users do not only consume information but also produce it. This dual role of the users leads to a fundamental design question, how to incentivize the users to explore (produce new information) rather than exploit (use existing information). We provide a first step in understanding this new aspect of the classical tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in the face of agents’ incentives. Our abstraction studies a novel model in which agents arrive sequentially one after the other and each in turn chooses one action from a fixed set of actions to maximize his expected rewards given the information he possesses at the time of arrival. (More concretely, each agent is a two-arm bandit, maximizing his own utility given the information he has observed.) The information that becomes available affects the incentives of an agent to explore and generate new information. We characterize the optimal disclosure policy of a planner whose goal is to maximizes social welfare. The planner's optimal policy is characterized and shown to be intuitive and very simple to implement. As the number of agents increases the social welfare converges to the optimal welfare of the unconstrained mechanism and the regret is bounded by a constant.

http://videolectures.net/colt2014_moitra_learning/,"In sparse recovery we are given a matrix A∈Rn×m (“the dictionary”) and a vector of the form AX where X is sparse, and the goal is to recover X. This is a central notion in signal processing, statistics and machine learning. But in applications such as sparse coding, edge detection, compression and super resolution, the dictionary A is unknown and has to be learned from random examples of the form Y=AX where X is drawn from an appropriate distribution - this is the dictionary learning problem. In most settings, A is overcomplete: it has more columns than rows. This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for learning overcomplete dictionaries; the only previously known algorithm with provable guarantees is the recent work of Spielman et al. (2012) who who gave an algorithm for the undercomplete case, which is rarely the case in applications. Our algorithm applies to incoherent dictionaries which have been a central object of study since they were introduced in seminal work of Donoho and Huo (1999). In particular, a dictionary is μ-incoherent if each pair of columns has inner product at most μ/n−√. The algorithm makes natural stochastic assumptions about the unknown sparse vector X, which can contain k≤cmin(n−√/μlogn,m1/2−η) non-zero entries (for any η>0). This is close to the best k allowable by the best sparse recovery algorithms even if one knows the dictionary A exactly. Moreover, both the running time and sample complexity depend on log1/ϵ, where ϵ is the target accuracy, and so our algorithms converge very quickly to the true dictionary. Our algorithm can also tolerate substantial amounts of noise provided it is incoherent with respect to the dictionary (e.g., Gaussian). In the noisy setting, our running time and sample complexity depend polynomially on 1/ϵ, and this is necessary."

Kruskal’s theorem has found many applications in proving the identifiability of parameters for various latent variable models and mixture models such as Hidden Markov models, topic models etc. Our robust version immediately implies identifiability using only polynomially many samples in many of these settings – an essential first step towards efficient learning algorithms.

Specifically we assume that nodes possess latent attributes drawn from a general compact space and edges between two nodes are randomly generated and labeled according to some unknown distribution as a function of their latent attributes. Our goal is then to infer the edge label distributions from a partially observed network. We propose a computationally efficient spectral algorithm and show it allows for asymptotically correct inference when the average node degree could be as low as logarithmic in the total number of nodes. Conversely, if the average node degree is below a specific constant threshold, we show that no algorithm can achieve better inference than guessing without using the observations.

This estimate is then refined via an iterative algorithm with the following alternating steps: 1) estimation of the dictionary coefficients for each observation through ℓ1 minimization, given the dictionary estimate, and 2) estimation of the dictionary elements through least squares, given the coefficient estimates. We establish that, under a set of sufficient conditions, our method converges at a linear rate to the true dictionary as well as the true coefficients for each observation."

http://videolectures.net/colt2014_ramaswamy_problems/,"A popular approach to solving multiclass learning problems is to reduce them to a set of binary classification problems through some output code matrix: the widely used one-vs-all and all-pairs methods, and the error-correcting output code methods of Dietterich and Bakiri (1995), can all be viewed as special cases of this approach. In this paper, we consider the question of statistical consistency of such methods. We focus on settings where the binary problems are solved by minimizing a binary surrogate loss, and derive general conditions on the binary surrogate loss under which the one-vs-all and all-pairs code matrices yield consistent algorithms with respect to the multiclass 0-1 loss. We then consider general multiclass learning problems defined by a general multiclass loss, and derive conditions on the output code matrix and binary surrogates under which the resulting algorithm is consistent with respect to the target multiclass loss. We also consider probabilistic code matrices, where one reduces a multiclass problem to a set of class probability labeled binary problems, and show that these can yield benefits in the sense of requiring a smaller number of binary problems to achieve overall consistency. Our analysis makes interesting connections with the theory of proper composite losses (Buja et al., 2005; Reid and Williamson, 2010); these play a role in constructing the right ‘decoding’ for converting the predictions on the binary problems to the final multiclass prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first work that comprehensively studies consistency properties of output code based methods for multiclass learning."
http://videolectures.net/colt2014_daniely_methods/,"Many popular learning algorithms (E.g. Regression, Fourier-Transform based algorithms, Kernel SVM and Kernel ridge regression) operate by reducing the problem to a convex optimization problem over a set of functions. These methods offer the currently best approach to several central problems such as learning half spaces and learning DNF’s. In addition they are widely used in numerous application domains. Despite their importance, there are still very few proof techniques to show limits on the power of these algorithms. We study the performance of this approach in the problem of (agnostically and improperly) learning halfspaces with margin γ. Let D be a distribution over labeled examples. The γ-margin error of a hyperplane h is the probability of an example to fall on the wrong side of h or at a distance ≤γ from it. The γ-margin error of the best h is denoted Errγ(D). An α(γ)-approximation algorithm receives γ,ϵ as input and, using i.i.d. samples of D, outputs a classifier with error rate ≤ α(γ)Errγ(D)+ϵ. Such an algorithm is efficient if it uses poly(1γ,1ϵ) samples and runs in time polynomial in the sample size. The best approximation ratio achievable by an efficient algorithm is O(1/γlog(1/γ)√) and is achieved using an algorithm from the above class. Our main result shows that the approximation ratio of every efficient algorithm from this family must be ≥ Ω(1/γ poly(log(1/γ))), essentially matching the best known upper bound."

We further show that every multi-label class of dimension 1 has a sample compression scheme using only sets of size at most 1. As opposed to the binary case, the latter result is not immediately implied by the former, since there are multi-label concept classes of dimension 1 that are not contained in maximum classes of dimension 1."
http://videolectures.net/colt2014_urner_labels/,"With the emergence of Machine Learning tools that allow handling data with a huge number of features, it becomes reasonable to assume that, over the full set of features, the true labeling is (almost) fully determined. That is, the labeling function is deterministic, but not necessarily a member of some known hypothesis class. However, agnostic learning of deterministic labels has so far received little research attention. We investigate this setting and show that it displays a behavior that is quite different from that of the fundamental results of the common (PAC) learning setups. First, we show that the sample complexity of learning a binary hypothesis class (with respect to deterministic labeling functions) is not fully determined by the VC-dimension of the class. For any d, we present classes of VC-dimension d that are learnable from O(d/ϵ)-many samples and classes that require samples of size Ω(d/ϵ2). Furthermore, we show that in this setup, there are classes for which any proper learner has suboptimal sample complexity. While the class can be learned with sample complexity O(d/ϵ), any proper (and therefore, any ERM) algorithm requires Ω(d/ϵ2) samples. We provide combinatorial characterizations of both phenomena, and further analyze the utility of unlabeled samples in this setting. Lastly, we discuss the error rates of nearest neighbor algorithms under deterministic labels and additional niceness-of-data assumptions."

http://videolectures.net/colt2014_anderson_learning/,"In this paper we show that very large mixtures of Gaussians are efficiently learnable in high dimension. More precisely, we prove that a mixture with known identical covariance matrices whose number of components is a polynomial of any fixed degree in the dimension n is polynomially learnable as long as a certain non-degeneracy condition on the means is satisfied. It turns out that this condition is generic in the sense of smoothed complexity, as soon as the dimensionality of the space is high enough. Moreover, we prove that no such condition can possibly exist in low dimension and the problem of learning the parameters is generically hard. In contrast, much of the existing work on Gaussian Mixtures relies on low-dimensional projections and thus hits an artificial barrier. Our main result on mixture recovery relies on a new ``Poissonization""-based technique, which transforms a mixture of Gaussians to a linear map of a product distribution. The problem of learning this map can be efficiently solved using some recent results on tensor decompositions and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), thus giving an algorithm for recovering the mixture. In addition, we combine our low-dimensional hardness results for Gaussian mixtures with Poissonization to show how to embed difficult instances of low-dimensional Gaussian mixtures into the ICA setting, thus establishing exponential information-theoretic lower bounds for underdetermined ICA in low dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result in the literature. In addition to contributing to the problem of Gaussian mixture learning, we believe that this work is among the first steps toward better understanding the rare phenomenon of the ``blessing of dimensionality"" in the computational aspects of statistical inference."

One of our main contributions is an improved and generalized algorithm for selecting a good candidate distribution from among competing hypotheses. Namely, given a collection of N hypotheses containing at least one candidate that is ε-close to an unknown distribution, our algorithm outputs a candidate which is O(ε)-close to the distribution. The algorithm requires O(logN/ε2) samples from the unknown distribution and O(NlogN/ε2) time, which improves previous such results (such as the Scheffé estimator) from a quadratic dependence of the running time on N to quasilinear.

http://videolectures.net/colt2014_jain_discrete_distributions/,"We study the problem of learning a distribution from samples, when the underlying distribution is a mixture of product distributions over discrete domains. This problem is motivated by several practical applications such as crowdsourcing, recommendation systems, and learning Boolean functions. The existing solutions either heavily rely on the fact that the number of mixtures is finite or have sample/time complexity that is exponential in the number of mixtures. In this paper, we introduce a polynomial time/sample complexity method for learning a mixture of r discrete product distributions over {1,2,…,ℓ}n, for general ℓ and r. We show that our approach is consistent and further provide finite sample guarantees. We use recently developed techniques from tensor decompositions for moment matching. A crucial step in these approaches is to construct certain tensors with low-rank spectral decompositions. These tensors are typically estimated from the sample moments. The main challenge in learning mixtures of discrete product distributions is that the corresponding low-rank tensors cannot be obtained directly from the sample moments. Instead, we need to estimate a low-rank matrix using only off-diagonal entries, and estimate a tensor using a few linear measurements. We give an alternating minimization based method to estimate the low-rank matrix, and formulate the tensor estimation problem as a least-squares problem."

http://videolectures.net/colt2014_van_erven_leader/,"We consider online prediction with expert advice. Over the course of many trials, the goal of the learning algorithm is to achieve small additional loss (i.e. regret) compared to the loss of the best from a set of K experts. The two most popular algorithms are Hedge/Weighted Majority and Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL). The latter algorithm first perturbs the loss of each expert by independent additive noise drawn from a fixed distribution, and then predicts with the expert of minimum perturbed loss (“the leader”) where ties are broken uniformly at random. To achieve the optimal worst-case regret as a function of the loss L∗ of the best expert in hindsight, the two types of algorithms need to tune their learning rate or noise magnitude, respectively, as a function of L∗. Instead of perturbing the losses of the experts with additive noise, we randomly set them to 0 or 1 before selecting the leader. We show that our perturbations are an instance of dropout — because experts may be interpreted as features — although for non-binary losses the dropout probability needs to be made dependent on the losses to get good regret bounds. We show that this simple, tuning-free version of the FPL algorithm achieves two feats: optimal worst-case O(L∗lnK−−−−−−√+lnK) regret as a function of L∗, and optimal O(lnK) regret when the loss vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed distribution and there is a gap between the expected loss of the best expert and all others. A number of recent algorithms from the Hedge family (AdaHedge and FlipFlop) also achieve this, but they employ sophisticated tuning regimes. The dropout perturbation of the losses of the experts result in different noise distributions for each expert (because they depend on the expert’s total loss) and curiously enough no additional tuning is needed: the choice of dropout probability only affects the constants."

These bounds are in terms of excess losses, the differences between the instantaneous losses suffered by the algorithm and the ones of a given expert. We then demonstrate the interest of these bounds in the context of experts that report their confidences as a number in the interval [0,1] using a generic reduction to the standard setting. We conclude by two other applications in the standard setting, which improve the known bounds in case of small excess losses and show a bounded regret against i.i.d. sequences of losses."

In the frequently encountered situation when sequential entropy and i.i.d. empirical entropy match, our results point to the interesting phenomenon that the rates for statistical learning with squared loss and online nonparametric regression are the same. In addition to a non-algorithmic study of minimax regret, we exhibit a generic forecaster that enjoys the established optimal rates.

http://videolectures.net/colt2014_yun_sampling/,"In this paper, we consider networks consisting of a finite number of non-overlapping communities. To extract these communities, the interaction between pairs of nodes may be sampled from a large available data set, which allows a given node pair to be sampled several times. When a node pair is sampled, the observed outcome is a binary random variable, equal to 1 if nodes interact and to 0 otherwise. The outcome is more likely to be positive if nodes belong to the same communities. For a given budget of node pair samples or observations, we wish to jointly design a sampling strategy (the sequence of sampled node pairs) and a clustering algorithm that recover the hidden communities with the highest possible accuracy. We consider both non-adaptive and adaptive sampling strategies, and for both classes of strategies, we derive fundamental performance limits satisfied by any sampling and clustering algorithm. In particular, we provide necessary conditions for the existence of algorithms recovering the communities accurately as the network size grows large. We also devise simple algorithms that accurately reconstruct the communities when this is at all possible, hence proving that the proposed necessary conditions for accurate community detection are also sufficient. The classical problem of community detection in the stochastic block model can be seen as a particular instance of the problems consider here. But our framework covers more general scenarios where the sequence of sampled node pairs can be designed in an adaptive manner. The paper provides new results for the stochastic block model, and extends the analysis to the case of adaptive sampling."

When the distribution of the outcomes are Gaussian, we prove that the complexity of the fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings are equivalent, and that uniform sampling of both alternatives is optimal only in the case of equal variances. In the common variance case, we also provide a stopping rule that terminates faster than existing fixed-confidence algorithms. In the case of Bernoulli distributions, we show that the complexity of fixed-budget setting is smaller than that of fixed-confidence setting and that uniform sampling of both alternatives—though not optimal—is advisable in practice when combined with an appropriate stopping criterion."
http://videolectures.net/colt2014_chandrasekaran_finding/,"We study the problem of learning a most biased coin among a set of coins by tossing the coins adaptively. The goal is to minimize the number of tosses until we identify a coin whose posterior probability of being most biased is at least 1−δ for a given δ. Under a particular probabilistic model, we give an optimal algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that minimizes the expected number of future tosses. The problem is closely related to finding the best arm in the multi-armed bandit problem using adaptive strategies. Our algorithm employs an optimal adaptive strategy—a strategy that performs the best possible action at each step after observing the outcomes of all previous coin tosses. Consequently, our algorithm is also optimal for any given starting history of outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that employs an optimal adaptive strategy under a Bayesian setting for this problem. Our proof of optimality employs mathematical tools from the area of Markov games."
http://videolectures.net/colt2014_guha_sampling/,"The Thompson Sampling (TS) policy is a widely implemented algorithm for the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. Given a prior distribution over possible parameter settings of the underlying reward distributions of the arms, at each time instant, the policy plays an arm with probability equal to the probability that this arm has largest mean reward conditioned on the current posterior distributions of the arms. This policy generalizes the celebrated “probability matching” heuristic which has been experimentally and widely observed in human decision making. However, despite its ubiquity, the Thompson Sampling policy is poorly understood. Our goal in this paper is to make progress towards understanding the empirical success of this policy. We proceed using the lens of approximation algorithms and problem definitions from stochastic optimization. We focus on an objective function termed stochastic regret that captures the expected number of times the policy plays an arm that is not the eventual best arm, where the expectation is over the prior distribution. Given such a definition, we show that TS is a 2–approximation to the optimal decision policy in two extreme but canonical scenarios. One such scenario is the two-armed bandit problem which is used as a calibration point in all bandit literature. The second scenario is stochastic optimization where the outcome of a random variable is revealed in a single play to a high or low deterministic value. We show that the 2 approximation is tight in both these scenarios. We provide an uniform analysis framework that in theory is capable of proving our conjecture that the TS policy is a 2–approximation to the optimal decision policy for minimizing stochastic regret, for any prior distribution and any time horizon."
http://videolectures.net/colt2014_magureanu_algorithms/,"We consider stochastic multi-armed bandit problems where the expected reward is a Lipschitz function of the arm, and where the set of arms is either discrete or continuous. For discrete Lipschitz bandits, we derive asymptotic problem specific lower bounds for the regret satisfied by any algorithm, and propose OSLB and CKL-UCB, two algorithms that efficiently exploit the Lipschitz structure of the problem. In fact, we prove that OSLB is asymptotically optimal, as its asymptotic regret matches the lower bound. The regret analysis of our algorithms relies on a new concentration inequality for weighted sums of KL divergences between the empirical distributions of rewards and their true distributions. For continuous Lipschitz bandits, we propose to first discretize the action space, and then apply OSLB or CKL-UCB, algorithms that provably exploit the structure efficiently. This approach is shown, through numerical experiments, to significantly outperform existing algorithms that directly deal with the continuous set of arms. Finally the results and algorithms are extended to contextual bandits with similarities."
http://videolectures.net/colt2014_samadi_herding/,"Herding is an algorithm of recent interest in the machine learning community, motivated by inference in Markov random fields. It solves the following sampling problem: given a set X⊂Rd with mean μ, construct an infinite sequence of points from X such that, for every t≥1, the mean of the first t points in that sequence lies within Euclidean distance O(1/t) of μ. The classic Perceptron boundedness theorem implies that such a result actually holds for a wide class of algorithms, although the factors suppressed by the O(1/t) notation are exponential in d. Thus, to establish a non-trivial result for the sampling problem, one must carefully analyze the factors suppressed by the O(1/t) error bound. This paper studies the best error that can be achieved for the sampling problem. Known analysis of the Herding algorithm give an error bound that depends on geometric properties of X but, even under favorable conditions, this bound depends linearly on d. We present a new polynomial-time algorithm that solves the sampling problem with error O(d√log2.5|X|/t) assuming that X is finite. Our algorithm is based on recent algorithmic results in discrepancy theory. We also show that any algorithm for the sampling problem must have error Ω(d√/t).

Alternatively, coverage functions can be described as non-negative linear combinations of monotone disjunctions. They are a natural subclass of submodular functions and arise in a number of applications. We give an algorithm that for any γ,δ>0, given random and uniform examples of an unknown coverage function c, finds a function h that approximates c within factor 1+γ on all but δ-fraction of the points in time poly(n,1/γ,1/δ). This is the first fully-polynomial algorithm for learning an interesting class of functions in the demanding PMAC model of Balcan and Harvey (2011). Our algorithms are based on several new structural properties of coverage functions. Using the results in (Feldman and Kothari, 2014), we also show that coverage functions are learnable agnostically with excess ℓ1-error ϵ over all product and symmetric distributions in time nlog(1/ϵ). In contrast, we show that, without assumptions on the distribution, learning coverage functions is at least as hard as learning polynomial-size disjoint DNF formulas, a class of functions for which the best known algorithm runs in time 2O(n1/3) (Klivans and Servedio, 2004). As an application of our learning results, we give simple differentially-private algorithms for releasing monotone conjunction counting queries with low average error.

http://videolectures.net/colt2014_kanade_distribution/,"We study several questions in the reliable agnostic learning framework of Kalai et al. (2009), which captures learning tasks in which one type of error is costlier than other types. A positive reliable classifier is one that makes no false positive errors. The goal in the positive reliable agnostic framework is to output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i) its false positive error rate is at most ϵ, (ii) its false negative error rate is at most ϵ more than that of the best positive reliable classifier from the class. A closely related notion is fully reliable agnostic learning, which considers partial classifiers that are allowed to predict “unknown” on some inputs. The best fully reliable partial classifier is one that makes no errors and minimizes the probability of predicting “unknown”, and the goal in fully reliable learning is to output a hypothesis that is almost as good as the best fully reliable partial classifier from a class. For distribution-independent learning, the best known algorithms for PAC learning typically utilize polynomial threshold representations, while the state of the art agnostic learning algorithms use point-wise polynomial approximations. We show that one-sided polynomial approximations, an intermediate notion between polynomial threshold representations and point-wise polynomial approximations, suffice for learning in the reliable agnostic settings. We then show that majorities can be fully reliably learned and disjunctions of majorities can be positive reliably learned, through constructions of appropriate one-sided polynomial approximations. Our fully reliable algorithm for majorities provides the first evidence that fully reliable learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning. Our algorithms also satisfy strong attribute-efficiency properties, and in many cases they provide smooth tradeoffs between sample complexity and running time."

Important recent results show that the problem can be solved efficiently under the assumption that the unknown matrix is incoherent and the subsample is drawn uniformly at random. Are these assumptions necessary? It is well known that Matrix Completion in its full generality is NP-hard. However, little is known if we make additional assumptions such as incoherence and permit the algorithm to output a matrix of slightly higher rank. In this paper we prove that Matrix Completion remains computationally intractable even if the unknown matrix has rank 4 but we are allowed to output any constant rank matrix, and even if additionally we assume that the unknown matrix is incoherent and are shown 90% of the entries. This result relies on the conjectured hardness of the 4-Coloring problem. We also consider the positive semidefinite Matrix Completion problem. Here we show a similar hardness result under the standard assumption that P≠NP. Our results greatly narrow the gap between existing feasibility results and computational lower bounds. In particular, we believe that our results give the first complexity-theoretic justification for why distributional assumptions are needed beyond the incoherence assumption in order to obtain positive results. On the technical side, we contribute several new ideas on how to encode hard combinatorial problems in low-rank optimization problems. We hope that these techniques will be helpful in further understanding the computational limits of Matrix Completion and related problems."

In particular, no ERM learner is optimal. This brings back the fundamental question of “how to learn”? We give a complete answer to this question by giving a new analysis of the one-inclusion multiclass learner of Rubinstein et el (2006) showing that its sample complexity is essentially optimal. Then, we turn to study the popular hypothesis class of generalized linear classifiers. We derive optimal learners that, unlike the one-inclusion algorithm, are computationally efficient.

Differential privacy is a strong and well-studied notion of privacy introduced by Dwork et al. (2006) that ensures that the output of an algorithm leaks little information about the data point provided by any of the participating individuals. Sample complexity of private PAC and agnostic learning was studied in a number of prior works starting with (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2008) but a number of basic questions still remain open (Beimel et al. 2010; Chaudhuri and Hsu, 2011; Beimel et al., 2013a,b). Our main contribution is an equivalence between the sample complexity of differentially-private learning of a concept class C (or SCDP(C)) and the randomized one-way communication complexity of the evaluation problem for concepts from C. Using this equivalence we prove the following bounds: SCDP(C)=Ω(LDim(C)), where LDim(C) is the Littlestone’s (1987) dimension characterizing the number of mistakes in the online-mistake-bound learning model. This result implies that SCDP(C) is different from the VC-dimension of C, resolving one of the main open questions from prior work.  For any t, there exists a class C such that LDim(C)=2 but SCDP(C)≥t.  For any t, there exists a class C such that the sample complexity of (pure) α-differentially private PAC learning is Ω(t/α) but the sample complexity of the relaxed (α,β)-differentially private PAC learning is O(log(1/β)/α). This resolves an open problem from (Beimel et al., 2013b).  We also obtain simpler proofs for a number of known related results.

Moreover, as opposed to previous works on approachability, and in the spirit of online learning, we do not assume that there is a known game structure with actions for two players. Rather, the player receives an arbitrary vector-valued reward vector at every round. We show that it is impossible, in general, to approach the best target set in hindsight. We further propose a concrete strategy that approaches a non-trivial relaxation of the best-in-hindsight given the actual rewards. Our approach does not require projection onto a target set and amounts to switching between scalar regret minimization algorithms that are performed in episodes."

Our recovery procedure is computationally efficient in that it requires only one linear scan of the coordinates. In our settings, the signal x∈RN is assumed to be nonnegative, i.e., xi≥0,∀ i. We prove that, when α∈(0, 0.5], it suffices to use M=(Cα+o(1))ϵ−α(∑Ni=1xαi)logN/δ measurements so that, with probability 1−δ, all coordinates will be recovered within ϵ additive precision, in one scan of the coordinates. The constant Cα=1 when α→0 and Cα=π/2 when α=0.5.

http://videolectures.net/colt2013_bernstein_problems/,"No-regret algorithms has played a key role in on-line learning and prediction problems. In this paper, we focus on a generalized no-regret problem with vector-valued rewards, defined in terms of a desired reward set of the agent. For each mixed action q of the opponent, the agent has a set R(q) where the average reward should reside. In addition, the agent has a response mixed action p which brings the expected reward under these two actions, r(p,q), to R(q). If a strategy of the agent ensures that the average reward converges to R(q¯n), where q¯n is the empirical distribution of the opponent’s actions, for any strategy of the opponent, we say that it is a no-regret strategy with respect to R(q). The standard no-regret problem is obtained as a special case for scalar rewards and R(q) = r∈R:r≥r(q), where r(q)=maxpr(p,q). For this problem, the multifunction R(q) is convex, and no-regret strategies can be devised. Our main interest in this paper is in cases where this convexity property does not hold. The best that can be guaranteed in general then is the convergence of the average reward to Rc(q¯n), the convex hull of R(q¯n). However, as the game unfolds, it may turn out that the opponent’s choices of actions are limited in some way. If these restrictions were known in advance, the agent could possibly ensure convergence of the average reward to some desired subset of Rc(q¯n), or even approach R(q¯n) itself. We formulate appropriate goals for opportunistic no-regret strategies, in the sense that they may exploit such limitations on the opponent’s action sequence in an on-line manner, without knowing them beforehand. As the main technical tool, we propose a class of approachability algorithms that rely on a calibrated forecast of the opponent’s actions, which are opportunistic in the above mentioned sense. As an application, we consider the online no-regret problem with average cost constraints, introduced in Mannor, Tsitsiklis, and Yu (2009), where the best-response-in-hindsight is not generally attainable, but only its convex relaxation. Our proposed algorithm applied to this problem does attain the best-response-in-hindsight if the opponent’s play happens to be stationary (either in terms of its mixed actions, or the empirical frequencies of its pure actions)."

Our result is proved by constructing an approximation of a submodular function by a DT of rank 4/ϵ2 and a proof that any rank-r DT can be ϵ-approximated by a DT of depth 52(r+log(1/ϵ)). We show that these structural results can be exploited to give an attribute-efficient PAC learning algorithm for submodular functions running in time O(n2)⋅2O(1/ϵ4). The best previous algorithm for the problem requires nO(1/ϵ2) time and examples (Cheraghchi et al., 2012) but works also in the agnostic setting. In addition, we give improved learning algorithms for a number of related settings. We also prove that our PAC and agnostic learning algorithms are essentially optimal via two lower bounds: (1) an information-theoretic lower bound of 2Ω(1/ϵ2/3) on the complexity of learning monotone submodular functions in any reasonable model (including learning with value queries); (2) computational lower bound of nΩ(1/ϵ2/3) based on a reduction to learning of sparse parities with noise, widely-believed to be intractable. These are the first lower bounds for learning of submodular functions over the uniform distribution."
http://videolectures.net/colt2013_hardt_algorithms/,"We consider a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning called subspace recovery: given a collection of m points in Rn, if many but not necessarily all of these points are contained in a d-dimensional subspace T can we find it? The points contained in T are called inliers and the remaining points are outliers. This problem has received considerable attention in computer science and in statistics. Yet efficient algorithms from computer science are not robust to adversarial outliers, and the estimators from robust statistics are hard to compute in high dimensions. This is a serious and persistent issue not just in this application, but for many other problems in unsupervised learning. Are there algorithms for subspace recovery that are both robust to outliers and efficient? We give an algorithm that finds T when it contains more than a d/n fraction of the points. Hence, for say d=n/2 this estimator is both easy to compute and well-behaved when there are a constant fraction of outliers. We prove that it is small set expansion hard to find T when the fraction of errors is any larger and so our estimator is an optimal compromise between efficiency and robustness. In fact, this basic problem has a surprising number of connections to other areas including small set expansion, matroid theory and functional analysis that we make use of here."

The size of the sample and the number of arithmetic operations of our algorithm are polynomial in n. This answers a question of Frieze, Jerrum and Kannan Frieze et al. (1996). Our result can also be interpreted as efficiently learning the intersection of n+1 half-spaces in Rn in the model where the intersection is bounded and we are given polynomially many uniform samples from it. Our proof uses the local search technique from Independent Component Analysis (ICA), also used by Frieze et al. (1996). Unlike these previous algorithms, which were based on analyzing the fourth moment, ours is based on the third moment. We also show a direct connection between the problem of learning a simplex and ICA: a simple randomized reduction to ICA from the problem of learning a simplex. The connection is based on a known representation of the uniform measure on a simplex. Similar representations lead to a reduction from the problem of learning an affine transformation of an n-dimensional lp ball to ICA."

http://videolectures.net/colt2013_ge_models/,"Modeling community formation and detecting hidden communities in networks is a well studied problem. However, theoretical analysis of community detection has been mostly limited to models with non-overlapping communities such as the stochastic block model. In this paper, we remove this restriction, and consider a family of probabilistic network models with overlapping communities, termed as the mixed membership Dirichlet model, first introduced in Aioroldi et. al (2008). This model allows for nodes to have fractional memberships in multiple communities and assumes that the community memberships are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. We propose a unified approach to learning these models via a tensor spectral decomposition method. Our estimator is based on low-order moment tensor of the observed network, consisting of 3-star counts. Our learning method is fast and is based on simple linear algebra operations, e.g. singular value decomposition and tensor power iterations. We provide guaranteed recovery of community memberships and model parameters and present a careful finite sample analysis of our learning method.

http://videolectures.net/colt2013_voss_signal/,"A prototypical blind signal separation problem is the so-called cocktail party problem, with n people talking simultaneously and n different microphones within a room. The goal is to recover each speech signal from the microphone inputs. Mathematically this can be modeled by assuming that we are given samples from a n-dimensional random variable X=AS, where S is a vector whose coordinates are independent random variables corresponding to each speaker. The objective is to recover the matrix A−1 given random samples from X. A range of techniques collectively known as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been proposed to address this problem in the signal processing and machine learning literature. Many of these techniques are based on using the kurtosis or other cumulants to recover the components. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for solving the blind signal separation problem in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, when we are given samples from X=AS+η, where η is drawn from an unknown, not necessarily spherical n-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Our approach is based on a method for decorrelating a sample with additive Gaussian noise under the assumption that the underlying distribution is a linear transformation of a distribution with independent components. Our decorrelation routine is based on the properties of cumulant tensors and can be combined with any standard cumulant-based method for ICA to get an algorithm that is provably robust in the presence of Gaussian noise. We derive polynomial bounds for sample complexity and error propagation of our method."

Importantly, ΠM can be computed in the optimal O(nnz(M)) time, where nnz(M) is the number of non-zero entries of M. This generalizes all previous oblivious subspace embeddings which required p∈[1,2] due to their use of p-stable random variables. Using our new matrices Π, we also improve the best known distortion of oblivious subspace embeddings of ℓ1 into ℓ1 with O(d) target dimension in O(nnz(M)) time from O(d3) to O(d2), which can further be improved to O(d3/2)log1/2n if d=Ω(logn), answering a question of Meng and Mahoney (STOC, 2013).

If one is just interested in a poly(d) rather than a (1+ϵ)-approximation to ℓp-regression, a corollary of our results is that for all p∈[1,∞) we can solve the ℓp-regression problem without using general convex programming, that is, since our subspace embeds into ℓ∞ it suffices to solve a linear programming problem. Finally, we give the first protocols for the distributed ℓp-regression problem for every p≥1 which are nearly optimal in communication and computation."
http://videolectures.net/colt2013_agarwal_bounds/,"The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely used performance measure in machine learning, and has been widely studied in recent years particularly in the context of bipartite ranking. A dominant theoretical and algorithmic framework for AUC optimization/bipartite ranking has been to reduce the problem to pairwise classification; in particular, it is well known that the AUC regret can be formulated as a pairwise classification regret, which in turn can be upper bounded using usual regret bounds for binary classification. Recently, Kotlowski et al. (2011) showed AUC regret bounds in terms of the regret associated with ‘balanced’ versions of the standard (non-pairwise) logistic and exponential losses. In this paper, we obtain such (non-pairwise) surrogate regret bounds for the AUC in terms of a broad class of proper (composite) losses that we term strongly proper. Our proof technique is considerably simpler than that of Kotlowski et al. (2011), and relies on properties of proper (composite) losses as elucidated recently by Reid and Williamson (2009, 2010, 2011) and others. Our result yields explicit surrogate bounds (with no hidden balancing terms) in terms of a variety of strongly proper losses, including for example logistic, exponential, squared and squared hinge losses. An important consequence is that standard algorithms minimizing a (non-pairwise) strongly proper loss, such as logistic regression and boosting algorithms (assuming a universal function class and appropriate regularization), are in fact AUC-consistent; moreover, our results allow us to quantify the AUC regret in terms of the corresponding surrogate regret. We also obtain tighter surrogate regret bounds under certain low-noise conditions via a recent result of Clémenand Robbiano (2011)."
http://videolectures.net/colt2013_wang_ranking/,"Ranking has been extensively studied in information retrieval, machine learning and statistics. A central problem in ranking is to design a ranking measure for evaluation of ranking functions. State of the art leaning to rank methods often train a ranking function by using a ranking measure as the objective to maximize. In this paper we study, from a theoretical perspective, the widely used NDCG type ranking measures. We analyze the behavior of these ranking measures as the number of objects to rank getting large. We first show that, whatever the ranking function is, the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic discount, converges to 1 as the number of items to rank goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result seems to imply that NDCG cannot distinguish good and bad ranking functions, contradicting to the empirical success of NDCG in many applications. Our next main result is a theorem which shows that although NDCG converge to the same limit for all ranking functions, it has distinguishability for ranking functions in a strong sense. We then investigate NDCG with other possible discount. Specifically we characterize the class of feasible discount functions for NDCG. We also compare the limiting behavior and the power of distinguishability of these feasible NDCG type measures to the standard NDCG. We next turn to the cut-off version of NDCG, i.e., NDCG@k. The most popular NDCG@k uses a combination of a slow logarithmic decay and a hard cut-off as its discount. So a natural question is why not simply use a smooth discount with fast decay? We show that if the decay is too fast, then the NDCG measure does not have strong power of distinguishability and even not converge. Finally, feasible NDCG@k are also discussed."
http://videolectures.net/colt2013_mahdavi_risk/,"In this paper we consider learning in passive setting but with a slight modification. We assume that the target expected loss, also referred to as target risk, is provided in advance for learner as prior knowledge. Unlike most studies in the learning theory that only incorporate the prior knowledge into the generalization bounds, we are able to explicitly utilize the target risk in the learning process. Our analysis reveals a surprising result on the sample complexity of learning: by exploiting the target risk in the learning algorithm, we show that when the loss function is both strongly convex and smooth, the sample complexity reduces to O(log(1ϵ)), an exponential improvement compared to the sample complexity O(1ϵ) for learning with strongly convex loss functions. Furthermore, our proof is constructive and is based on a computationally efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for such settings which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is practically useful."
http://videolectures.net/colt2013_blanchard_noise/,"In many real-world classification problems, the labels of training examples are randomly corrupted. Thus, the set of training examples for each class is contaminated by examples of the other class. Previous theoretical work on this problem assumes that the two classes are separable, that the label noise is independent of the true class label, or that the noise proportions for each class are known. We introduce a general framework for classification with label noise that eliminates these assumptions. Instead, we give assumptions ensuring identifiability and the existence of a consistent estimator of the optimal risk, with associated estimation strategies. For any arbitrary pair of contaminated distributions, there is a unique pair of non-contaminated distributions satisfying the proposed assumptions, and we argue that this solution corresponds in a certain sense to maximal denoising. In particular, we find that learning in the presence of label noise is possible even when the class-conditional distributions overlap and the label noise is not symmetric. A key to our approach is a universally consistent estimator of the maximal proportion of one distribution that is present in another, a problem we refer to as“mixture proportion estimation. This work is motivated by a problem in nuclear particle classification."
http://videolectures.net/colt2013_zhang_regression/,"We study a decomposition-based scalable approach to performing kernel ridge regression. The method is simply described: it randomly partitions a dataset of size N into m subsets of equal size, computes an independent kernel ridge regression estimator for each subset, then averages the local solutions into a global predictor. This partitioning leads to a substantial reduction in computation time versus the standard approach of performing kernel ridge regression on all N samples. Our main theorem establishes that despite the computational speed-up, statistical optimality is retained: that so long as m is not too large, the partition-based estimate achieves optimal rates of convergence for the full sample size N. As concrete examples, our theory guarantees that m may grow polynomially in N for Sobolev spaces, and nearly linearly for finite-rank kernels and Gaussian kernels. We conclude with simulations complementing our theoretical results and exhibiting the computational and statistical benefits of our approach."
http://videolectures.net/colt2013_bach_matrix/,"We consider supervised learning problems within the positive-definite kernel framework, such as kernel ridge regression, kernel logistic regression or the support vector machine. With kernels leading to infinite-dimensional feature spaces, a common practical limiting difficulty is the necessity of computing the kernel matrix, which most frequently leads to algorithms with running time at least quadratic in the number of observations n, i.e., O(n2). Low-rank approximations of the kernel matrix are often considered as they allow the reduction of running time complexities to O(p2n), where p is the rank of the approximation. The practicality of such methods thus depends on the required rank p. In this paper, we show that for approximations based on a random subset of columns of the original kernel matrix, the rank p may be chosen to be linear in the degrees of freedom associated with the problem, a quantity which is classically used in the statistical analysis of such methods, and is often seen as the implicit number of parameters of non-parametric estimators. This result enables simple algorithms that have sub-quadratic running time complexity, but provably exhibit the same predictive performance than existing algorithms, for any given problem instance, and not only for worst-case situations."
http://videolectures.net/colt2013_vandermeulen_kernel/,The kernel density estimator (KDE) based on a radial positive-semidefinite kernel may be viewed as a sample mean in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This mean can be viewed as the solution of a least squares problem in that space. Replacing the squared loss with a robust loss yields a robust kernel density estimator (RKDE). Previous work has shown that RKDEs are weighted kernel density estimators which have desirable robustness properties. In this paper we establish asymptotic L1 consistency of the RKDE for a class of losses and show that the RKDE converges with the same rate on bandwidth required for the traditional KDE. We also present a novel proof of the consistency of the traditional KDE.

The first control of this type is in the separable case, where a distribution-dependent relaxed weak learning rate induces speedy convergence with high probability over any sample. Otherwise, in the nonseparable case, the convex surrogate risk itself exhibits distribution-dependent levels of curvature, and consequently the algorithm’s output has small norm with high probability."

Under the assumption that these concept classes have bounded VC dimension, we prove existence of a compression scheme. This result is motivated by recent progress in the field of model theory with respect to an analogues problem. In fact, our proof can be considered as a constructive proof of these advancements.

We consider settings in which there is a well-defined answer, in the following sense: Suppose that there is a nonprivate model selection procedure f, which is the reference to which we compare our performance. Our differentially private algorithms output the correct value f(D) whenever f is stable on the input data set D. We work with two notions, perturbation stability and sub-sampling stability. We give two classes of results: generic ones, that apply to any function with discrete output set; and specific algorithms for the problem of sparse linear regression. The algorithms we describe are efficient and in some cases match the optimal non-private asymptotic sample complexity. Our algorithms for sparse linear regression require analyzing the stability properties of the popular LASSO estimator.

Membership query algorithms are not popular among machine learning practitioners. Apart from the obvious difficulty of adaptively querying labellers, it has also been observed that querying unnatural points leads to increased noise from human labellers (Lang and Baum, 1992). This motivates our study of learning algorithms that make queries that are close to examples generated from the data distribution. We restrict our attention to functions defined on the n-dimensional Boolean hypercube and say that a membership query is local if its Hamming distance from some example in the (random) training data is at most O(log(n)). We show the following results in this model: 1. The class of sparse polynomials (with coefficients in R) over {0,1}n is polynomial time learnable under a large class of locally smooth distributions using O(log(n))-local queries. This class also includes the class of O(log(n))-depth decision trees. 2. The class of polynomial-sized decision trees is polynomial time learnable under product distributions using O(log(n))-local queries. 3.

In this paper, we investigate the attainable error/regret in the bandit and derivative-free settings, as a function of the dimension d and the available number of queries T. We provide a precise characterization of the attainable performance for strongly-convex and smooth functions, which also imply a non-trivial lower bound for more general problems.

In the full-information setting, the player after choosing her action can observe the whole loss function in that round, while in the bandit setting, the only information the player can observe is the loss value of that action. Designing such bandit algorithms appears challenging, as the best regret currently achieved for general convex loss functions is much higher than that in the full-information setting, while for strongly convex loss functions, there is even a regret lower bound which is exponentially higher than that achieved in the full-information setting. To aim for smaller regrets, we adopt a relaxed two-point bandit setting in which the player can play two actions in each round and observe the loss values of those two actions. Moreover, we consider loss functions parameterized by their deviation D, which measures how fast they evolve, and we study how regrets depend on D. We show that two-point bandit algorithms can in fact achieve regrets matching those in the full-information setting in terms of D. More precisely, for convex loss functions, we achieve a regret of O(D−−√), while for strongly convex loss functions, we achieve a regret of O(lnD), which is much smaller than the Ω(D−−√) lower bound in the traditional bandit setting."

Our framework simultaneously captures such well-known notions as internal and general ϕ-regret, learning with non-additive global cost functions, Blackwell's approachability, calibration of forecasters, and more. We show that learnability in all these situations is due to control of the same three quantities: a martingale convergence term, a term describing the ability to perform well if future is known, and a generalization of sequential Rademacher complexity, studied in [21]. Since we directly study complexity of the problem instead of focusing on efficient algorithms, we are able to improve and extend many known results which have been previously derived via an algorithmic construction."
http://videolectures.net/colt2011_daniely_principle/,"Multiclass learning is an area of growing practical relevance, for which the currently available theory is still far from providing satisfactory understanding. We study the learnability of multiclass prediction, and derive upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of multiclass hypothesis classes in different learning models: batch/online, realizable/ unrealizable, full information/bandit feedback. Our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: In the multiclass setting, in sharp contrast to binary classification, not all Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithms are equally successful. We show that there exist hypotheses classes for which some ERM learners have lower sample complexity than others. Furthermore, there are classes that are learnable by some ERM learners, while other ERM learner will fail to learn them. We propose a principle for designing good ERM learners, and use this principle to prove tight bounds on the sample complexity of learning symmetric multiclass hypothesis classes (that is, classes that are invariant under any permutation of label names). We demonstrate the relevance of the theory by analyzing the sample complexity of two widely used hypothesis classes: generalized linear multiclass models and reduction trees. We also obtain some practically relevant conclusions."
http://videolectures.net/colt2011_shamir_filtering/,"Trace-norm regularization is a widely-used and successful approach for collaborative filtering and matrix completion. However, its theoretical understanding is surprisingly weak, and despite previous attempts, there are no distribution-free, non-trivial learning guarantees currently known. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing such guarantees, under mild assumptions which correspond to collaborative filtering as performed in practice. In fact, we claim that previous difficulties partially stemmed from a mismatch between the standard learning-theoretic modeling of collaborative filtering, and its practical application. Our results also shed some light on the issue of collaborative filtering with bounded models, which enforce predictions to lie within a certain range. In particular, we provide experimental and theoretical evidence that such models lead to a modest yet significant improvement."

Here we study low-rank matrix reconstruction using both the trace-norm, as well as the less-studied max-norm, and present reconstruction guarantees based on existing analysis on the Rademacher complexity of the unit balls of these norms. We show how these are superior in several ways to recently published guarantees based on specialized analysis."

In the context of this problem, algorithms based on association rules have a distinct advantage over classical statistical and machine learning methods; however, there has not previously been a theoretical foundation estab- lished for using association rules in supervised learning. We present two simple algorithms that incorporate association rules, and provide generalization guarantees on these algo- rithms based on algorithmic stability analysis from statistical learning theory. We include a discussion of the strict minimum support threshold often used in association rule mining, and introduce an \adjusted condence"" measure that provides a weaker minimum support condition that has advantages over the strict minimum support.

We prove such regret bounds for an online-learning algorithm called SeqSEW and based on exponential weighting and data-driven truncation. In a second part we apply a parameter-free version of this algorithm on i.i.d. data and derive risk bounds of the same  flavor as in Dalalyan and Tsybakov (2008, 2011) but which solve two questions left open therein.

http://videolectures.net/colt2011_feldman_functions/,"Valiant’s (2007) model of evolvability models the evolutionary process of acquiring useful functionality as a restricted form of learning from random examples. Linear threshold functions and their various subclasses, such as conjunctions and decision lists, play a fundamental role in learning theory and hence their evolvability has been the primary focus of research on Valiant’s framework (2007). One of the main open problems regarding the model is whether conjunctions are evolvable distribution-independently (Feldman and Valiant, 2008). We show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on a new combinatorial parameter of a concept class that lower-bounds the complexity of learning from correlations. We contrast the lower bound with a proof that linear threshold functions having a non-negligible margin on the data points are evolvable distribution-independently via a simple mutation algorithm. Our algorithm relies on a non-linear loss function being used to select the hypotheses instead of 0-1 loss in Valiant’s (2007) original definition. The proof of evolvability requires that the loss function satisfies several mild conditions that are, for example, satisfied by the quadratic loss function studied in several other works (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009; P. Valiant, 2010). An important property of our evolution algorithm is monotonicity, that is the algorithm guarantees evolvability without any decreases in performance. Previously, monotone evolvability was only shown for conjunctions with quadratic loss (Feldman, 2009) or when the distribution on the domain is severely restricted (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009; Kanade et al. , 2010)."
http://videolectures.net/colt2011_lee_formulas/,"Much work has been done on learning various classes of “simple” monotone functions under the uniform distribution. In this paper we give the first unconditional lower bounds for learning problems of this sort by showing that polynomial-time algorithms cannot learn shallow monotone Boolean formulas under the uniform distribution in the well-studied Statistical Query (SQ) model. We introduce a new approach to understanding the learnability of “simple” monotone functions that is based on a recent characterization of Strong SQ learnability by Simon (2007) Using the characterization we first show that depth-3 monotone formulas of size no(1) cannot be learned by any polynomial-time SQ algorithm to accuracy 1 􀀀 1=(log n (1): We then build on this result to show that depth-4 monotone formulas of size no(1) cannot be learned even to a certain 1 2 + o(1) accuracy in polynomial time. This improved hardness is achieved using a general technique that we introduce for amplifying the hardness of “mildly hard” learning problems in either the PAC or SQ framework. This hardness amplification for learning builds on the ideas in the work of O’Donnell (2004) on hardness amplification for approximating functions using small circuits, and is applicable to a number of other contexts. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can also be used to reduce the well-known open problem of learning juntas to learning of depth-3 monotone formulas."

http://videolectures.net/colt2011_hsu_learning/,"We study the problem of privacy-preserving classification – namely, learning a classifier from sensitive data, while still preserving the privacy of individuals in the training set. In particular, we require that our learning algorithm guarantees differential privacy, a very strong notion of privacy that has gained significant attention over the past few years. A natural question to ask is: what is the sample requirement of a learning algorithm that guarantees a certain level of privacy and accuracy? In this paper, we study this question in the context of infinite hypothesis classes when the data is drawn from a continuous distribution. We show that even for very simple hypothesis classes, any algorithm which uses a finite number of examples and guarantees differential privacy, fails to guarantee classification accuracy for at least one unlabeled data distribution. This result is unlike the case of finite hypothesis classes and hypothesis classes on discrete data domains that were studied by Kasiviswanathan et al. (2008). We then propose two approaches to differentially private learning that get around this lower bound. The first approach is to use some prior knowledge about the unlabeled data distribution in the form of a reference distribution U that is chosen independently of the sensitive data. Given such a reference U, we provide an upper bound on the sample requirement which depends (among other things) on a measure of closeness between U and the unlabeled data distribution. Our upper bound applies to the non-realizable as well as the realizable case. The second approach is to relax the privacy requirement, by requiring only label-privacy – namely, that the labels, and not the unlabeled parts of the examples be considered sensitive information. An upper bound on the sample requirement of learning with label privacy was shown by Chaudhuri et al. (2006); in this paper, we show a lower bound."

http://videolectures.net/colt2011_gao_consistency/,"Multi-label learning has attracted much attention during the past few years. Many multilabel learning approaches have been developed, mostly working with surrogate loss functions since multi-label loss functions are usually difficult to optimize directly owing to non-convexity and discontinuity. Though these approaches are effective, to the best of our knowledge, there is no theoretical result on the convergence of risk of the learned functions to the Bayes risk. In this paper, focusing on two well-known multi-label loss functions, i.e., ranking loss and hamming loss, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of multi-label learning based on surrogate loss functions. Our results disclose that, surprisingly, none convex surrogate loss is consistent with the ranking loss. Inspired by the finding, we introduce the partial ranking loss, with which some surrogate functions are consistent. For hamming loss, we show that some recent multi-label learning approaches are inconsistent even for deterministic multi-label classification, and give a surrogate loss function which is consistent for the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss on the consistency of learning approaches which address multi-label learning by decomposing into a set of binary classification problems."
http://videolectures.net/colt2011_vainsencher_dictionary/,"A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary. Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classification, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a given set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the error in representing by such a dictionary a previously unseen signal from the same source will be of similar magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a fixed distribution, and study these questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefficient selection, as measured by the expected L2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l1 regularized coefficient selection we provide a generalization bound of the order of O, where n is the dimension, p is the number of elements in the dictionary, λ is a bound on the l1 norm of the coefficient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O under an assumption on the closeness to orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results also include bounds that converge as 1=m, not previously known for this problem. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements."

Our primary interest is formally understanding the fundamental benefits of transfer learning, compared to learning each target independently from the others. Our approach to the transfer problem is general, in the sense that it can be used with a variety of learning protocols. The key insight driving our approach is that the distribution of the target concepts is identifiable from the joint distribution over a number of random labeled data points equal the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of the concept space. This is not necessarily the case for the joint distribution over any smaller number of points. This work has particularly interesting implications when applied to active learning methods."

The proposed classifier is obtained by minimizing an empirical objective subject to an empirical constraint. The novelty of the method is that the classifier output by this problem is shown to satisfy the original constraint on type I error. This strict enforcement of the constraint has interesting consequences on the control of the type II error and we develop new techniques to handle this situation. Finally, connections with chance constrained optimization are evident and are investigated."

A major limitation of the standard KWIK framework is that, by its very definition, it covers only the case when the (model) learner can represent the actual environment with no errors. In this paper, we introduce the agnostic KWIK learning model, where we relax this assumption by allowing nonzero approximation errors.

http://videolectures.net/colt2011_slivkins_bandits/,"In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, an online algorithm makes a sequence of choices. In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives and receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between arms. We consider similarity information in the setting of contextual bandits, a natural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm is given the context – a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on webpages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a similarity distance between the context-arm pairs which bounds from above the difference between the respective expected payoffs. Prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses “uniform” partitions of the similarity space, so that each context-arm pair is approximated by the closest pair in the partition. Algorithms based on “uniform” partitions disregard the structure of the payoffs and the context arrivals, which is potentially wasteful. We present algorithms that are based on adaptive partitions, and take advantage of ”benign” payoffs and context arrivals without sacrificing the worst-case performance. The central idea is to maintain a finer partition in high-payoff regions of the similarity space and in popular regions of the context space. Our results apply to several other settings, e.g. MAB with constrained temporal change (Slivkins and Upfal, 2008) and sleeping bandits (Kleinberg et al., 2008a)."

Our first result shows that at iteration t, the exponential loss of AdaBoost’s computed parameter vector will be at most ε more than that of any parameter vector of l1-norm bounded by B in a number of rounds that is at most a polynomial in B and 1/ε. We also provide lower bounds showing that a polynomial dependence on these parameters is necessary. Our second result is that within C/ε iterations, AdaBoost achieves a value of the exponential loss that is at most ε more than the best possible value, where C depends on the dataset.

We complement this result by proving that any algorithm has expected regret of Ω(log(T)) in the online stochastic strongly-convex optimization setting. This lower bound holds even in the full-information setting which reveals more information to the algorithm than just gradients.

Assuming that the outcomes are generated in an i.i.d. fashion from an arbitrary and unknown probability distribution, we characterize the minimax regret of any partial monitoring game with finitely many actions and outcomes.

We then extend this result to multiclass proper losses where there are few existing results. We show that mixability is governed by the Hessian of the Bayes risk, relative to the Hessian of the Bayes risk for log loss.

http://videolectures.net/colt2011_kotlowski_maximum/,"The paper considers sequential prediction of individual sequences with log loss (online density estimation) using an exponential family of distributions. We first analyze the regret of the maximum likelihood (""follow the leader"") strategy. We find that this strategy is (1) suboptimal and (2) requires an additional assumption about boundedness of the data sequence. We then show that both problems can be be addressed by adding the currently predicted outcome to the calculation of the maximum likelihood, followed by normalization of the distribution. The strategy obtained in this way is known in the literature as the sequential normalized maximum likelihood or last-step minimax strategy. We show for the first time that for general exponential families, the regret is bounded by the familiar (k=2) log n and thus optimal up to O(1). We also show the relationship to the Bayes strategy with Jereys' prior."
