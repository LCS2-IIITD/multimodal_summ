http://videolectures.net/sikdd2016_choloniewski_slovene_media/,"We present results of a study on usage of text similarity measures based on co-occurrence of words and phrases to classify a relation between a pair of news articles (i.e. no relation, both based on a common source, one based on the other). For each Slovenian article written in Slovene and published online on 27th June 2016, we found the most similar release from the Slovenian Press Agency (STA) database to obtain a list of candidate article-source pairs. Four experts from STA were asked to score the pairs, and their annotations were used to train classifiers and evaluate their accuracy."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2016_kladnik_website_visit_logs/,"This paper provides three use-cases of combining website visit logs with user segment data, website content and stock volume data. The use-cases provide concrete examples showcasing how to derive insights into behavior of users on the website. We also present how to efficiently derive required data using MapReduce technique, and implement the use-cases using QMiner data analytics platform."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2016_novak_videoLectures/,"This paper presents learning analytics tools for visual and statistical analysis of data from a portal of video lectures. While learning analytics methods traditionally deal with measurement, collection and analysis of data about learners with an aim of improving the learning process, our solutions are targeted at viewers of VideoLectures.NET. The novel VideoLectures Learning Analytics Dashboard and Lecture Landscape tools allow observing, searching and analyzing viewer behavior and, at the same time, efficiently present the information from the portal to the viewers."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2016_pita_costa_aquaculture/,"The specific challenges in aquaculture today reveal needs and problems that must be addressed appropriately and in sync with the most recent optimization methods. It is now the time to bring the techniques of aquaculture to a new level of development and understanding. In that, one must consider the state of the art methods of statistics and data mining that permit a deeper insight into the aquaculture reality through the collected datasets, either from daily data or from sampling to sampling data. This must also be tuned to the expert knowledge of the fish farmers, their procedures and technology in use today. In this paper we review the state of the art of data analytics methodology in aquaculture, the data available deriving from the procedures characteristic to this business, and propose mathematical models that permit a deeper insight on the data. We also address the data unknowns and strategies developed that will contribute to the success of the business, leading to discover valuable information from the data that can be made usable, relevant and actionable."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2016_senozetnik_clustering_methods/,"Tracking a person, an animal, or a vehicle generates a vast amount of spatio-temporal data, that has to be processed and analyzed differently from ordinary data generally used in knowledge discovery. This paper presents existing spatiotemporal clustering algorithms, suitable for such data and compares their running time, noise sensitivity, quality of results and the ability to discover clusters according to nonspatial, spatial and temporal values of the objects."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2016_urbancic_accelerometer_readings/,"This paper describes a method for automatic transportation mode detection based on smartphone sensors. Our approach is designed to work in real-time as it only requires 5s of sensor readings for the detection. Because we used accelerometer instead of GPS signal it uses less battery power and is therefore more user and phone-friendly. For the mode detection we use multiple support vector machine models which enable us distinguishing between multiple modes (bus, train, car). Before the classification, raw measurements are preprocessed in order to cancel out the constant acceleration that is caused by the force of gravity. The results of the paper are promising and are based on the collected training data from approximately 20 hours of driving on trains and public buses in Ljubljana."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2016_herga_modeling_probability/,"Creditors carry the risk of their clients not meeting their debt obligations. In the literature, these events are often referred to as default events. These can be modeled for each company through a probability of default (PD). Measures can be taken to limit the default risk: in this paper we focused on credit limit. Firstly, we predict PD of a company using a logistic regression model, based on publicly available financial data. Secondly, we effectively find an optimal portfolio under risk aversion constraints and show how variation of inputs affects the results."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2016_fuart_innovation_funding_programmes/,"This paper gives an introduction to the European Programme for Internet Innovation and the needs for advanced analytical techniques in assessment of the socio-economic impact of funded projects. A technical overview and architecture of developed IT tools follows. Broadly, two set of tools were explored. (1) An on-line assessment environment that provides programme managers and companies with feedback about their potential socio-economic impact. For this set of tools the emphasis is on visualisation techniques, therefore a detailed rationale and scientific background for those is provided with usage examples. (2) Statistical modules for identification of funding approaches that, potentially, provide best results (”best practices”) have been developed and applied to available data. Through one use-case we have shown that the proposed IT system is useful in measuring the impact of innovation funding programmes, detecting good management practices and giving support to funded projects. The whole system has been published on a public repository with an open source license, giving opportunity to re-use, customize and integrate the reporting system into other impact assessment environments."
