http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_bauckhage_mathematical_models/,"Internet memes are a pervasive phenomenon on the social Web. They typically consist of viral catch phrases, images, or videos that spread through instant messaging, (micro) blogs, forums, and social networking sites. Due to their popularity and proliferation, Internet memes attract interest in areas as diverse as marketing, sociology, or computer science and have been dubbed a new form of communication or artistic expression. In this paper, we examine the merits of such claims and analyze how collective attention into Internet memes evolves over time. We introduce and discuss statistical models of the dynamics of fads and fit them to meme related time series obtained from Google Trends. Given data as to more than 200 memes, we find that our models provide more accurate descriptions of the dynamics of growth and decline of collective attention to individual Internet memes than previous approaches from the literature. In short, our results suggest that Internet memes are nothing but fads."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_tabourier_epidemic_model/,"Citation cascades in blog networks are often considered as traces of information spreading on this social medium. In this work, we question this point of view using both a structural and semantic analysis of five months activity of the most representative blogs of the french-speaking community. Statistical measures reveal that our dataset shares many features with those that can be found in the literature, suggesting the existence of an identical underlying process. However, a closer analysis of the post content indicates that the popular epidemic-like descriptions of cascades are misleading in this context. A basic model, taking only into account the behavior of bloggers and their restricted social network, accounts for several important statistical features of the data. These arguments support the idea that citations primary goal may not be information spreading on the blogosphere."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_dow_facebook_cascades/,"When users post photos on Facebook, they have the option of allowing their friends, followers, or anyone at all to subsequently reshare the photo. A portion of the billions of photos posted to Facebook generates cascades of reshares, enabling many additional users to see, like, comment, and reshare the photos. In this paper we present characteristics of such cascades in aggregate, finding that a small fraction of photos account for a significant proportion of reshare activity and generate cascades of non-trivial size and depth. We also show that the true influence chains in such cascades can be much deeper than what is visible through direct attribution. To illuminate how large cascades can form, we study the diffusion trees of two widely distributed photos: one posted on President Barack Obama’s page following his reelection victory, and another posted by an individual Facebook user hoping to garner enough likes for a cause.We show that the two cascades, despite achieving comparable total sizes, are markedly different in their time evolution, reshare depth distribution, predictability of subcascade sizes, and the demographics of users who propagate them. The findings suggest not only that cascades can achieve considerable size but that they can do so in distinct ways."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_das_self_censorship/,"We report results from an exploratory analysis examining “last-minute” self-censorship, or content that is filtered after being written, on Facebook. We collected data from 3.9 million users over 17 days and associate self-censorship behavior with features describing users, their social graph, and the interactions between them. Our results indicate that 71% of users exhibited some level of last-minute self-censorship in the time period, and provide specific evidence supporting the theory that a user’s “perceived audience” lies at the heart of the issue: posts are censored more frequently than comments, with status updates and posts directed at groups censored most frequently of all sharing use cases investigated. Furthermore, we find that: people with more boundaries to regulate censor more; males censor more posts than females and censor even more posts with mostly male friends than do females, but censor no more comments than females; people who exercise more control over their audience censor more content; and, users with more politically and age diverse friends censor less, in general."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_schoenebeck_online_moms/,"Moms are one of the fastest growing demographics online. While much is known about where they spend their time, little is known about how they spend it. Using a dataset of over 51 million posts and comments from the website YouBeMom.com, this paper explores what kinds of topics moms talk about when they are not constrained by norms and expectations of face-to-face culture. Results show that almost 5% of posts are about dh, or ""dear husband"", but these posts tend to express more negative emotion than other posts. The average post is only 124 characters long and family and daily life are common categories of posting. This suggests that YouBeMom is used as a fast-paced social outlet that may not be available to moms in other parts of their lives. This work concludes with a discussion of anonymity and disinhibition and puts forth a new provocation that moms, too, spend time online ""for the lulz""."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_jang_social_networks/,"Influential people are known to play a key role in diffusing information in a social network. When measuring influence in a social network, most studies have focused on the use of the graph topology representing a network. As a result, popular or famous people tend to be identified as influencers. While they have a potential to influence people with the network connections by propagating information to their friends or followers, it is not clear whether they can indeed serve as an influencer as expected, especially for specific topic areas. In this paper, we introduce the notion of dedicators, which measures the extent to which a user has dedicated to transmit information in selected topic areas to the people in their egocentric networks. To detect topic-based dedicators, we propose a measure that combines both community- level and individual-level factors, which are related to the volume and the engagement level of their conversations and the degree of focus on specific topics. Having analyzed a Twitter conversation data set, we show that dedicators are not co-related with topology-based influencers; users with high in-degree influence tend to have a low dedication level while top dedicators tend to have richer conversations with others, taking advantage of smaller and manageable social networks."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_zarro_repository_building/,"We present findings from a qualitative study of activity on Pinterest.com, in which we investigated professional and personal uses of the site using interview data and observations of online activity. We find that Pinterest serves as an infrastructure for repository building that supports a wide range of activities including: discovery, collecting, collaborating, and publishing. We discuss these concepts using the language of “boundary objects” from the sociology of science. We suggest that scale is a critical dimension of boundary objects for understanding how people make sense of Pinterest and their diverse goals for using it. Professionals often attempt to use Pinterest to create repositories that scale to groups, organizations and societies and interface with multiple social worlds whereas personal repositories often have highly localized meanings. Our approach builds on quantitative descriptions of Pinterest to understand how the site fits into a growing ecology of social network sites."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_hodas_paradox_redux/,"Feld’s friendship paradox states that ""your friends have more friends than you, on average"". This paradox arises because extremely popular people, despite being rare, are overrepresented when averaging over friends. Using a sample of the Twitter firehose, we confirm that the friendship paradox holds for >98% of Twitter users. Because of the directed nature of the follower graph on Twitter, we are further able to confirm more detailed forms of the friendship paradox: everyone you follow or who follows you has more friends and followers than you. This is likely caused by a correlation we demonstrate between Twitter activity, number of friends, and number of followers. In addition, we discover two new paradoxes: the virality paradox that states “your friends receive more viral content than you, on average,” and the activity paradox, which states “your friends are more active than you, on average.” The latter paradox is important in regulating online communication. It may result in users having difficulty maintaining optimal incoming information rates, because following additional users causes the volume of incoming tweets to increase super-linearly. While users may compensate for increased information flow by increasing their own activity, users become information overloaded when they receive more information than they are able or willing to process. We compare the average size of cascades that are sent and received by overloaded and underloaded users. And we show that overloaded users post and receive larger cascades and they are poor detector of small cascades."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_ellison_facebook_friends/,"Past research suggests Facebook use is linked to perceptions of social capital, a concept that taps into the resources people gain from interactions with their social network. In this study, we examine a sample of public Facebook status updates (N=20,000) for instances in which users request a response from their network. These attempts to mobilize resources offer insight into the mechanisms through which Facebook is used for social capital conversion. After identifying mobilization requests (N=856), we categorize them by cost (i.e., effort needed to satisfy the request) and type (e.g., opinion, information, social coordination) in order to describe the prevalence of these requests and the extent to which they require effort on the part of the potential responders. Finally, we examine characteristics of these users and the linguistic characteristics of status updates that contain mobilization requests."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_fourney_citehistory/,"Software engineers often use Q&A forums like Stack Overflow and MSDN to ask and answer technical questions. Through a survey study and web browser log analysis, we find that both askers and answerers of technical forum questions typically conduct extensive online research before composing their posts. The inclusion of links to these research materials is beneficial to the forum participants, though post authors do not always include such citations. Based on these findings, we developed CiteHistory, a browser plugin that simplifies the process of including relevant search queries and URLs as bibliographic supplements to forum posts, and supports information re-finding for post authors. We discuss the results of a two-week deployment of CiteHistory with professional software engineers, which demonstrated that CiteHistory increased reference inclusion in posts, and offered auxiliary benefits as a personal research tracker."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_kairam_social_media/,"Many search engines identify bursts of activity around particular topics and reflect these back to users as Popular Now or Hot Searches. Activity around these topics typically evolves quickly in real-time during the course of a trending event. Users’ informational needs when searching for such topics will vary depending on the stage at which they engage with an event. Through a survey and log study, we observe that interaction with content about trending events varies significantly with prior awareness of the event. Building on this observation, we conduct a larger-scale analysis of query logs and social media data associated with hundreds of trending events. We find that search and social media activity tend to follow similar temporal patterns, but that social media activity leads by a few hours. While user interest in trending event content predictably diverges during peak activity periods, the overlap between content searched and shared increases. We discuss how these findings relate to the design of interfaces to better support sensemaking around trending events by integrating real-time social media content with traditional search results."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_hristova_social_mapping/,"OpenStreetMap has grown rapidly into an exemplary geowiki, where contributors collectively build an open map of the world. Official ‘mapping party’ events are organized on a regular basis to invite users to socialize, map and to engage new-comers locally. Here, we measure the direct and indirect impact of mapping parties on user contributions in both the short and long terms. We question whether this social mapping is a cause for users to become highly committed through a social bond, or is an effect of the mappers’ need to find a common social ground. We show that mapping parties have distinct effects on different types of users, with a more profound direct impact on weaker contributors and a longer term effect on heavy contributors."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_jurgens_social_relationships/,"Social networks are often grounded in spatial locality where individuals form relationships with those they meet nearby. However, the location of individuals in online social networking platforms is often unknown. Prior approaches have tried to infer individuals’ locations from the content they produce online or their online relations, but often are limited by the available location-related data. We propose a new method for social networks that accurately infers locations for nearly all of individuals by spatially propagating location assignments through the social network, using only a small number of initial locations. In five experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness in multiple social networking platforms, using both precise and noisy data to start the inference, and present heuristics for improving performance. In one experiment, we demonstrate the ability to infer the locations of a group of users who generate over 74% of the daily Twitter message volume with an estimated median location error of 10km. Our results open the possibility of gathering large quantities of location-annotated data from social media platforms."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_morstatter_comparing_data/,"Twitter is a social media giant famous for the exchange of short, 140-character messages called “tweets”. In the scientific community, the microblogging site is known for openness in sharing its data. It provides a glance into its millions of users and billions of tweets through a “Streaming API” which provides a sample of all tweets matching some parameters preset by the API user. The API service has been used by many researchers, companies, and governmental institutions that want to extract knowledge in accordance with a diverse array of questions pertaining to social media. The essential drawback of the Twitter API is the lack of documentation concerning what and how much data users get. This leads researchers to question whether the sampled data is a valid representation of the overall activity on Twitter. In this work we embark on answering this question by comparing data collected using Twitter’s sampled API service with data collected using the full, albeit costly, Firehose stream that includes every single published tweet. We compare both datasets using common statistical metrics as well as metrics that allow us to compare topics, networks, and locations of tweets. The results of our work will help researchers and practitioners understand the implications of using the Streaming API."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_garcia_gavilanes_twitter/,"Previous studies have established the link between one’s actions (e.g., engaging with others vs. minding one’s own business) and one’s national culture (e.g., collectivist vs. individualistic), and such actions have been shown to be important as they are collectively affiliated with a country’s economic outcomes (e.g., Gross Domestic Product). Hitherto there has not been any systematic study of whether one’s action on Twitter (e.g., deciding when to post messages) is linked to one’s culture (e.g., country’s Pace of Life). To fix that, we build different network snapshots starting from 55,000 seed users on Twitter, and we do so for 10 weeks across 30 countries (after filtering those with low penetration rates) for a total of 2.34Mprofiles. Based on Hofstede’s theory of cultural dimensions and Levine’s Pace of Life theory, we consider three behavioral patterns on Twitter (i.e., temporal predictability of tweets, engaging with others, and supporting others who are less popular) and associate them with three different dimensions derived from the two theories: Pace of Life, Individualism and Power Distance. We find the following strong correlations: activity predictability negatively correlates with Pace of Life (r = −0.62), tweets with mentions negatively correlates with Individualism (r = −0.55), and power (e.g, Twitter popularity) imbalance in relationships (between, for example, two users mentioning each other) is correlated with Power Distance (r = 0.62). These three cultural dimensions matter because they are associated with a country’s socio-economic aspects - with GDP per capita, income inequality, and education expenditure."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_lin_social_dynamics/,"We examine the growth, survival, and context of 256 novel hashtags during the 2012 U.S. presidential debates. Our analysis reveals the trajectories of hashtag use fall into two distinct classes: ""winners"" that emerge more quickly and are sustained for longer periods of time than other ""also-rans"" hashtags. We propose a ""conversational vibrancy"" framework to capture dynamics of hashtags based on their topicality, interactivity, diversity, and prominence. Statistical analyses of the growth and persistence of hashtags reveal novel relationships between features of this framework and the relative success of hashtags. Specifically, retweets always contribute to faster hashtag adoption, replies extend the life of ""winners"" while having no effect on ""also-rans."" This is the first study on the lifecycle of hashtag adoption and use in response to purely exogenous shocks. We draw on theories of uses and gratification, organizational ecology, and language evolution to discuss these findings and their implications for understanding social influence and collective action in social media more generally."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_tan_topical_structure/,"People’s interests and people’s social relationships are intuitively connected, but understanding their interplay and whether they can help predict each other has remained an open question. We examine the interface of two decisive structures forming the backbone of online social media: the graph structure of social networks - who connects with whom - and the set structure of topical affiliations - who is interested in what. In studying this interface, we identify key relationships whereby each of these structures can be understood in terms of the other. The context for our analysis is Twitter, a complex social network of both follower relationships and communication relationships. On Twitter, “hashtags” are used to label conversation topics, and we examine hashtag usage alongside these social structures. We find that the hashtags that users adopt can predict their social relationships, and also that the social relationships between the initial adopters of a hashtag can predict the future popularity of that hashtag. By studying weighted social relationships, we observe that while strong reciprocated ties are the easiest to predict from hashtag structure, they are also much less useful than weak directed ties for predicting hashtag popularity. Importantly, we show that computationally simple structural determinants can provide remarkable performance in both tasks. While our analyses focus on Twitter, we view our findings as broadly applicable to topical affiliations and social relationships in a host of diverse contexts, including the movies people watch, the brands people like, or the locations people frequent."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_lakkaraju_social_media/,"Creating, placing, and presenting social media content is a difficult problem. In addition to the quality of the content itself, several factors such as the way the content is presented (the title), the community it is posted to, whether it has been seen before, and the time it is posted determine its success. There are also interesting interactions between these factors. For example, the language of the title should be targeted to the community where the content is submitted, yet it should also highlight the distinctive nature of the content. In this paper, we examine how these factors interact to determine the popularity of social media content. We do so by studying resubmissions, i.e., content that has been submitted multiple times, with multiple titles, to multiple different communities. Such data allows us to ‘tease apart’ the extent to which each factor influences the success of that content. The models we develop help us understand how to better target social media content: by using the right title, for the right community, at the right time."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_ruths_political_orientation/,"Numerous papers have reported great success at inferring the political orientation of Twitter users. This paper has some unfortunate news to deliver: while past work has been sound and often methodologically novel, we have discovered that reported accuracies have been systemically overoptimistic due to the way in which validation datasets have been collected, reporting accuracy levels nearly 30% higher than can be expected in populations of general Twitter users. Using careful and novel data collection and annotation techniques, we collected three different sets of Twitter users, each characterizing a different degree of political engagement on Twitter - from politicians (highly politically vocal) to “normal” users (those who rarely discuss politics). Applying standard techniques for inferring political orientation, we show that methods which previously reported greater than 90% inference accuracy, actually achieve barely 65% accuracy on normal users. We also show that classifiers cannot be used to classify users outside the narrow range of political orientation on which they were trained. While a sobering finding, our results quantify and call attention to overlooked problems in the latent attribute inference literature that, no doubt, extend beyond political orientation inference: the way in which datasets are assembled and the transferability of classifiers."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_munson_browser_widget/,"The Internet gives individuals more choice in political news and information sources and more tools to filter out disagreeable information. Citing the preference described by selective exposure theory - people prefer information that supports their beliefs and avoid counter-attitudinal information - observers warn that people may use these tools to access only agreeable information and thus live in ideological echo chambers. We report on a field deployment of a browser extension that showed users feedback about the political lean of their weekly and all time reading behaviors. Compared to a control group, showing feedback led to a modest move toward balanced exposure, corresponding to 1-2 visits per week to ideologically opposing sites or 5-10 additional visits per week to centrist sites."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_calais_guerra_polarization/,"Polarization in social media networks is a fact in several scenarios such as political debates and other contexts such as same-sex marriage, abortion and gun control. Understanding and quantifying polarization is a longterm challenge to researchers from several areas, also being a key information for tasks such as opinion analysis. In this paper, we perform a systematic comparison between social networks that arise from both polarized and non-polarized contexts. This comparison shows that the traditional polarization metric – modularity – is not a direct measure of antagonism between groups, since non-polarized networks may be also divided into fairly modular communities. To bridge this conceptual gap, we propose a novel polarization metric based on the analysis of the boundary of a pair of (potentially polarized) communities, which better captures the notions of antagonism and polarization. We then characterize polarized and non-polarized social networks according to the concentration of high-degree nodes in the boundary of communities, and found that polarized networks tend to exhibit low concentration of popular nodes along the boundary. To demonstrate the usefulness of our polarization measures, we analyze opinions expressed on Twitter on the gun control issue in the United States, and conclude that our novel metrics help making sense of opinions expressed on online media."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_teodoro_personal_health/,"With the growing interest in how online sedentary activity can mediate offline health practices, we present a study of social media activity related to personal health and fitness. We aim to identify the type of content and motivations for sharing health-related activity in social media outlets. To this end, we performed a qualitative analysis of Twitter posts, as well as an extensive set of interviews with experienced users who post messages on Twitter about exercise, diet, and weight loss activities. The qualitative analysis exposes varying levels of activity actualization and message sentiment. The interviews help us reason about the users practices and motivations for posting activity related to the pursuit and maintenance of volitional health behaviors. Our findings extend existing theoretical frameworks and can inform the design of technology that uses social media to help initiate and maintain challenging activities like exercise and diet."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_park_perception_differences/,"One’s state of mind will influence her perception of the world and people within it. In this paper, we explore attitudes and behaviors toward online social media based on whether one is depressed or not.We conducted semistructured face-to-face interviews with 14 active Twitter users, half of whom were depressed and the other half non-depressed. Our results highlight key differences between the two groups in terms of perception towards online social media and behaviors within such systems. Non-depressed individuals perceived Twitter as an information consuming and sharing tool, while depressed individuals perceived it as a tool for social awareness and emotional interaction. We discuss several design implications for future social networks that could better accommodate users with depression and provide insights towards helping depressed users meet their needs through online social media."
