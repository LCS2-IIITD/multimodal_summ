http://videolectures.net/iswc06_panel_fts/,"In the recent years semantic technologies have demonstrated their usefulness and applicability in a variety of domains, the Semantic Web being the most prominent one. The Semantic Web has started to move from academic research to deployed business-critical and scientific applications, with support from recommendations (standards) developed under W3C governance and a growing list of commercial technologies and products is being developed. These developments seem to be early but firm steps in establishing semantics as a core column of computer science and application development. The outreach of this development can only be assessed to limited degree at the moment, but most likely will affect key aspects of society and the way we communicate.  This high potential was recognized early by funding agencies all over the world. However, after the first strong funding in US by DARPA, subsequent research funding seems to be limited. Europe seems to have seem more substantial and sustained funding, at least during last few years. Now may be a good time to assess what has been achieved so far and how funding agencies see future research directions, funding opportunities and funding environments, i.e., what are the planned strategies and instruments of funding agencies to maximize the impact of future research in semantics. We consider it specifically interesting to the research community to hear the opinions and plans of the major funding bodies around the world and to learn about their view on future issues/requirements/applications/challenges related to semantics and Semantic Web-- and by extension their opinion on the needs of industry, government and education for research in the Semantic Web and related areas."
http://videolectures.net/iswc06_panel_rsw/,"Currently, the web phenomenon that is driving the best developers and captivating the best entrepreneurs is Web 2.0. Web 2.0 encompasses some of today's most exciting web-based applications: mashups, blogs/wikis/feeds, interface remixes, and social networking/tagging systems. Although most Web 2.0 applications rely on an implicit, lightweight, shared semantics in order to deliver user value, by several metrics (number of startups funded, number of ""hype"" articles in the trade press, number of conferences), Web 2.0 technologies are significantly outdistancing semweb technologies in both implementation and mindshare. Hackers are staying up late building mashups with AJAX and REST and microformats, and only rarely including RDF and OWL. This panel will consider whether semantic web technology has a role in Web 2.0 applications, in at least the context of the following areas:  1. Web 2.0 and Semantics: What unique value can semantic web technologies supply to Web 2.0 application areas? How do semantic web technologies match up with the semantic demands of Web 2.0 applications?  2. Semantics and Web ""Ecosystems"": Web 2.0 applications often strive to build participatory ecosystems of content that is supplied and curated by their users. Can these users effectively create, maintain, map between, and use RDF/OWL content in a way that reinforces the ecosystem?  3. Semantic Web in Practice: Does semantic web technology enable the cost-effective creation of Web 2.0 applications that are simple, scalable, and compelling for a targeted user community? Can semantic web technology genuinely strengthen Web 2.0 applications, or will it just be a footnote to the Web 2.0 wave?"
http://videolectures.net/iswc06_gruber_wswms/,"The Semantic Web is an ecosystem of interaction among computer systems. The social web is an ecosystem of conversation among people. Both are enabled by conventions for layered services and data exchange. Both are driven by human-generated content and made scalable by machine-readable data. Yet there is a popular misconception that the two worlds are alternative, opposing ideologies about how the web ought to be. Folksonomy vs. ontology. Practical vs. formalistic. Humans vs. machines.  This is nonsense, and it is time to embrace a unified view. I subscribe to the vision of the Semantic Web as a substrate for collective intelligence. The best shot we have of collective intelligence in our lifetimes is large, distributed human-computer systems. The best way to get there is to harness the ""people power"" of the Web with the techniques of the Semantic Web. In this presentation I will show several ways that this can be, and is, happening."
http://videolectures.net/iswc06_fountain_pc/,"The virtual state is a metaphor meant to draw attention to the structures and processes of the state that are becoming increasingly aligned with the structures and processes of the semantic web. Semantic Web researchers understand the potential for information sharing, enhanced search, improved collaboration, innovation, and other direct implications of contemporary informatics. Yet many of the broader democratic and governmental implications of increasingly networked governance remain elusive, even in the world of public policy and politics."
http://videolectures.net/iswc06_studer_sc/,"The notion of the Semantic Web can be coined as a Web of data when bringing database content to the Web or as a Web of enriched human-readable content when encoding the semantics of web-resources in a machine-interpretable form.     It has been clear from the beginning that realizing the Semantic Web vision will require interdisciplinary research. At this the fifth ISWC, it is time to re-examine the extent to which interdisciplinary work has played and can play a role in Semantic Web research, and even how Semantic Web research can contribute to other disciplines. Core Semantic Web research has drawn from various disciplines, such as knowledge representation and formal ontologies, reusing and further developing their techniques in a new context."

http://videolectures.net/iswc06_fountain_ijf/,"Fountain is the author of Building the Virtual State: Information Technology and Institutional Change (Brookings Institution Press, 2001) which was awarded an Outstanding Academic Title in 2002 by Choice. The book has become a classic text in the field and has been translated into and published in Chinese, Japanese and Portuguese. Fountain is currently researching the successor volume to Building the Virtual State, which will examine technology-based cross-agency innovations in the U.S. federal government and their implications for governance and democratic processes, and Women in the Information Age (to be published by Cambridge University Press), which focuses on gender, information technology, and institutional behavior.  Professor Fountain also directs the Science, Technology, and Society Initiative (STS) and the Women in the Information Age Project (WITIA). The STS Initiative serves as a catalyst for collaborative, multi-disciplinary research partnerships among social, natural and physical scientists. WITIA examines the participation of women in computing and information-technology related fields and, with its partner institutions, seeks to increase the number of women experts and designers in information and communication technology fields.  She has served on several governing bodies and advisory groups in the public, private and nonprofit sectors in the U.S. and abroad. Her executive teaching and invited lectures have taken her to several developing countries and governments in transition including those of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nicaragua, Chile, Estonia, Hungary, and Slovenia as well as to countries including Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the countries of the European Union."

http://videolectures.net/iswc06_grobelnik_cskrs/,"The main goal of this tutorial is to provide an extensive survey of the past and current work in the area of context related topics. This includes analysis of the past work: (1) defining the notion of “context”, (2) present logic-based formalisms for dealing with contexts, (3) present probabilistic/fuzzy approaches to model context, (4) demonstrate “modelling the context” and “reasoning with contexts” in real-life applications. In addition, the presented work we will provide a synthesis of the past work in the light of a unified categorization of context-related approaches along several dimensions which appear as relevant from theoretical and practical point of view."
