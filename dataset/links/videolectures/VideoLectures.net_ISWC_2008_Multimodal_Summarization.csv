Video advertisement is becoming more and more popular and films, music and videoclips are largely consumed from legacy commercial databases. Re-using such multimedia material is, however, still a hard problem. Why is it so difficult to find appropriate multimedia content, to reuse and repurpose content previously published and to adapt interfaces to these content according to different user needs? This tutorial proposes to cover these questions. Based on established media workflow practices, we describe a small number of fundamental processes of media production. We explain how multimedia metadata can be represented, attached to the content it describes, and benefits from the web that contains more and more formalized knowledge (the Web of linked data). We show how web applications can benefit from semantic metadata for creating, searching and presenting multimedia content."

Not only due to the recent uptake of RDFa (Digg, Yahoo!, etc.), learning how and where to use RDFa is essential. This tutorial will introduce the usage of RDFa in real-world use cases and will enable the attendees to work with RDFa both on the client as on the server side. We will create, publish and consume RDFa-marked-up data in the course of the tutorial and discuss advanced aspects, such as dynamic content handling. There are no pre-requisites for participation in the tutorial other than a familiarity with the basics of the (Semantic) Web such as URIs, RDF, XHTML, and SPARQL."
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_saggion_krebi/,"Business Intelligence (BI) requires the acquisition and aggregation of key pieces of knowledge from multiple sources in order to provide business analysts with valuable information or feed statistical BI models and tools. The massive amount of textual and multimedia information available to business analysts makes information extraction and semantic-based digital tools key enablers for the acquisition and management of semantic information. The role of Ontologies is important here, since they promote interoperability and uniform and standardized access to heterogeneous sources and software components. In addition they encode rules for deduction of new knowledge from extracted data. The tutorial will give an overview of approaches to identify, extract, and consolidate semantic information for business intelligence, also stressing the role of temporal information. The tutorial will take a practical hands-on approach in which theoretical concepts and approaches are presented together with case studies on semantic-based tools in the context of the 6th Framework Programme Musing Integrated Project which is targeting three different vertical domains: Financial Risk Management; Internationalisation; and IT Operational Risk Management."
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_moller_itsr/,"We will provide a brief introduction to OWL, in fact OWL2, and the underlying Description Logic, clarifying the semantics and providing examples to help the understanding of this admittedly complex formalism. In particular, we will discuss common misunderstandings around OWL and OWL2, explain the open world assumption, inferences, and the functionality of reasoners. We will use the RacerPro reasoner to demonstrate the benefit of using reasoning for query answering over ontologies. Scalability issues with respect to expressive ontologies as well as huge assertional knowledge bases are discussed."
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_dellaValle_rswa/,"You are aware of the Semantic Web, but you haven’t got time to develop a Semantic Web application yourself? During this tutorial we challenge the Semantic Web technologies on the Web 2.0 ground of realizing a mash-up that reuses, transforms and combines existing data taken from the open Web. RSWA tutorial explains how to develop step-by-step a Semantic Web application that expects a music style as an input; retrieves data from online music archives and event databases; merges them and let the users explore events related to artists that practice the required style. The result is a Semantic Web Application we named Music Event Explorer or shortly meex; try it out at http://swa.cefriel.it/meex!"
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_heath_hpldw/,"The Web is increasingly understood as a global information space consisting not just of linked documents, but also of Linked Data. The Linked Data principles provide a basis for realizing this Web of Data, or Semantic Web. Since early 2007 numerous data sets have been published on the Web according to these principles, in domains as broad as music, books, geographical information, films, people, events, reviews and photos. In combination these data sets consist of over 2 billion RDF triples, interlinked by more than 3 million triples that cross data sets. As this Web of Linked Data continues to grow, and an increasing number of applications are developed that exploit these data sets, there is a growing need for data publishers, researchers, developers and Web practitioners to understand Linked Data principles and practice. Run by some of the leading members of the Linked Data community, this tutorial will address those needs, and provide participants with a solid foundation from which to begin publishing Linked Data on the Web, as well as to implement applications that consume Linked Data from the Web."
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_prudhommeaux_swhcls/,"The W3C Semantic Web in Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group (HCLSIG) has used RDF tools to integrate several large biological and clinical databases. This has simplified access to relational and hierarchical data and enabled third party additions to the database. HCLSIG demonstrates the use of Semantic Web technologies to access data on a web scale, taking advantage of OWL and rules to allow queries to re-purpose data without the need to coordinate with the data custodian. This tutorial will introduce OWL and rule mappings of databases, as well as introduce good practices for data modeling and publication. The use of SKOS for terminologies will also be described. Attendees will learn possible applications of Semantic Web tools to share data between and within organizations and solve large scale data integration problems. This tutorial will discuss how publishers of biological and clinical data can use OWL and rules to model their data and how users of Semantic Web tools can access this more diverse data. Attendees should be familiar with the Semantic Web languages RDF, Turtle, SPARQL and be introduced to OWL. These materials will be covered in the earlier RSWA tutorial."
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_witbrock_fsc/,"OpenCyc will be more accessible and Semantic Web interoperability will be enhanced if users are able to access just the parts of OpenCyc they need. The tutorial will describe how Semantic Web researchers and practitioners can benefit from integrating their representations with the extensive upper and middle level ontological content of the free and unrestricted OpenCyc knowledge base, and other integrative vocabularies like Okkam. The syntax of OpenCyc will be described both in raw form, and as mapped onto Semantic Web standard languages, and the content of the knowledge base will be described in overview. Based on that, we’ll show how to extend the OpenCyc KB for user applications, and how to make use of it in a web-services environment to support knowledge integration, and simple machine learning applications. Finally, we’ll demonstrate the use of the OpenCyc vocabulary to support a broad-applicability knowledge capture application, illustrative of the transition from Web2.0 to Web3.0. Hands on exercises will be used to illustrate knowledge use and construction, use of OpenCyc with inference, and use for semantic search over text in a web services environment."
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_jain_msw/,"The Capture, Storage, Sharing, Organizing, Retrieval, and Use of knowledge dominate most socio-economic activities in our society. Most of the knowledge in the world is initially captured and stays in the form of experiences in different sensing modalities. Current technology can address knowledge in text because in text the experiential data is converted to symbols by humans. Converting sensory data to symbols in computer systems has been difficult, primarily due to our inability to formally represent and effectively model the appropriate context within which the multimedia sensory data should be interpreted. This problem of integrating continuous multimedia and symbolic data becomes more urgent as multimedia data is becoming common, and the resulting social applications on the Web are required to deal with semantics of multimedia data. Clearly, the collection of searchable multimedia experiences will facilitate progress in sciences and the quality of human life in every part of the world, across all economies and cultures. In this paper, we will present challenges offered by semantics of multimedia data, review emerging semantic web approaches towards addressing these challenges, and present some example applications that are being developed to address these emerging challenges."
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_giannandrea_fowdw/,"Freebase is an open database of the world’s information, built by a global community and free for anyone to query, contribute to, and build applications on. Drawing from large open data sets like Wikipedia, MusicBrainz, GNIS, EDGAR etc., Freebase is curated by a passionate community of users and contains structured information on millions of topics such as people, places, music, film, food, science, historical events, and more. Part of what makes this open database unique is that it spans domains, but requires that a particular topic exist only once in Freebase. Thus freebase is an identity database with a user contributed schema which spans multiple domains. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger may appear in a movie database as an actor, a political database as a governor, and in a bodybuilder database as Mr. Universe. In Freebase, however, there is only one topic for Arnold Schwarzenegger that brings all these facets together. The unified topic is a single reconciled identity, which makes it easier to find and contribute information about the linked world we live in."
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_decker_mib/,"Enormous resources are poured into projects like the Large Hadron Collider, the Hubble space telescope, or the Iter fusion reactor. Computer science resources pale in comparison – the European Semantic Web effort is tiny compared to those projects. Why is this the case? Does the Semantic Web (or computer science in general) promise less impact or relevance than those Physics projects? In my talk I will argue that the Physicists are much better in formulating an engaging mission and message. Especially the Semantic Web community has not been very good in coming up with a convincing mission directed to the public. We need to and we can do better. I will formulate requirements and a starting point for such a message and investigate ongoing seemingly unrelated research areas and trends on the Semantic Web like Semantic Sensor Networks, Social Semantic Desktop and Semantic Publishing and how they contributes to a better conveyable mission."
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_swcbtc/,"The central idea of the Semantic Web is to extend the current human-readable web by encoding some of the semantics of resources in a machine-processable form. Moving beyond syntax opens the door to more advanced applications and functionality on the Web. Computers will be better able to search, process, integrate and present the content of these resources in a meaningful, intelligent manner. The core technological building blocks are now in place and widely available: ontology languages, flexible storage and querying facilities, reasoning engines, etc. Standards and guidelines for best practice are being formulated and disseminated by the W3C. The Semantic Web Challenge offers participants the chance to show the best of the Semantic Web. The Challenge thus serves several purposes: Helps us illustrate to society what the Semantic Web can provide Gives researchers an opportunity to showcase their work and compare it to others Stimulates current research to a higher final goal by showing the state-of-the-art every year"
http://videolectures.net/iswc08_staab_lt/,"This year, ISWC will include a session of “Lightning Talks”. The session provides an opportunity for participants to present ideas, comments, calls for collaboration, scathing polemic criticisms,… controversy and discussion are positively encouraged!! We would particularly welcome observations or comments arising from material presented during the conference."
