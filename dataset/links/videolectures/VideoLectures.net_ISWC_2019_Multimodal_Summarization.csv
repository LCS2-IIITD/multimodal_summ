Written expression and communication have allowed to get rid of time and space in knowledge transmission. They allow learning directly from elaborated knowledge instead of by experience. These key features have led the creation of whole cultures, providing a selective advantage to the species. The worldwide web facilitating cultural exchange is a culminating point in this story, so far. Hence, the idea of a semantic web allowing machines to have a grasp on this knowledge is a tremendous idea. Alas, after twenty years, the semantic web field is mostly focused on data, even when it is made of so-called knowledge graphs. Of course, there are schemata and vocabularies, but they are only a simple kind of knowledge. Although data may be open, knowledge eventually learnt by machines is very often not disclosed nor prone to communication. This brings us down the knowledge evolution ladder. The grand goal of formally expressing knowledge on the web must be rehabilitated. We do not need knowledge cast in stone for ever, but knowledge that can seamlessly evolve; we do not need to build one single knowledge source, but encourage diversity which is source of disputation and robustness; we do not need consistent knowledge at the web scale, but local theories that can be combined. We will discuss in particular how knowledge can be made live and evolve by taking inspiration from cultural evolution and evolutionary epistemology."

In particular, radio astronomy is foremost in the field in terms of big data generation, and thanks to sustained global investment in the discipline over the last decade, present telescopes generate tens of petabytes of data per annum. The pinnacle of this so-called on-going ‘radio renaissance’ will be the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) — a global observatory tasked with probing the deepest mysteries of the Universe. The SKA will create the highest resolution, fastest frame rate movie of the evolving Universe ever and in doing so will generate 160 terrabytes of raw data a day, or close to 5 zettabytes of data per annum. These data will be processed into of order 1 petabyte of image cubes per day which will be processed, curated, and ultimately distributed via a network of coordinated tiered compute facilities to the global astronomical community for scientific exploitation. However, this truly data-rich environment will require new automated and semantic processes to fully exploit the vast sea of results generated. In fact, to fully realize the enormous scientific potential of this endeavour, we will need not only better data tagging and coordination mechanisms, but also improved algorithms, artificial intelligence, semantics and ontologies to track and extract knowledge in an automated way at a scale not yet attempted in science. In this keynote I will present an overview of the SKA project, outline the “big data” challenges the project faces and discuss some of the approaches we are taking to tame this astronomical data deluge."

In this talk I will show how semantic technology can help solve the modern data complexity, integration and flexibility issues for business computing technologies, both from a technical and psychological perspective and suggest some challenges and opportunities for further research and collaboration."
