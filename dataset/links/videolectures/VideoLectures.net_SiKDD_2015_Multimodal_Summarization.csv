http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_belyaeva_pursuit_news/,"The paper addresses a problem of pursuit of journalistic news values, more specifically frequency, threshold and proximity through various text mining methods is presented. We illustrate how text mining can assists journalistic work by finding ideological, often orthodox news values of different international publishers across the world news that contribute to ubiquitous news bias. Our experiments on selected publishers and on news about Apple’s launch of new iPhone 6 and Apple Watch confirm that journalists still follow some of the well known journalistic values."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_gubiani_mining_literature/,"In this paper we demonstrate how literature mining can support experts in biomedicine on their way towards new discoveries. This is very important in complex, not yet sufficiently understood domains, where connections between different sub-specialities and fields of expertise have to be connected to fully understand the phenomena involved. As a case study, we present our preliminary literature mining work in the domain of ageing. The results confirm very recent discoveries about connections between diet and degenerative diseases, and indicate some concrete directions for further research needed to reveal the connections between microbiota and Alzheimer disease."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_eftimov_bakery_products/,"In this paper, we present the analytical results of the ingredients matching in bakery products. We collected recipes from a free recipes web site and the main goal was to find association rules between the recipes’ ingredients. For this purpose we applied an Apriori algorithm and various visualization techniques to represent the discovered association rules. The paper covers: data extraction, data preprocessing, association rules and visualization of the results during this work"
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_zajec_ngram_collection/,"This paper presents an efficient indexing technique suitable for indexing large n-gram collections with an emphasis on full wildcard query support and speed efficiency. Further we used this technique in building the n-gram search engine, on top of Google’s Web 1T 5-gram collection, whose advantages are interactive querying and fast result retrieval with tradeoff on higher memory consumption."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_rei_event_detection/,"We present two methods for event detection in Twitter using an event knowledge base. The knowledge base used contains world events reported in the media that we identify as multi-lingual clusters of mainstream news stories. Given this fact, we reduce the problem of event detection to matching tweets to mainstream news stories. The first method consists of using URLs to mainstream news sites present in tweets and in the knowledge base. We use this method to build a supervised corpus of tweets and then create and evaluate a supervised classifier as our second method. Experimental evaluation on real-world data shows that the proposed methods perfom well on our dataset"
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_panov_ontodm_ontology/,"This paper presents the first steps towards integrating concepts from the field of network analysis into the OntoDM ontology of data mining concepts. We have performed an extensive analysis of different subfieds of network analysis to provide a broad overview of the variety of tasks and algorithms that are encountered in the field. The main part of this work was to categorize the tasks and algorithms into a hierarchy that is consistent with the structure of OntoDM and which can systematically cover as many aspects of network analysis as possible. This work is a first step in the direction of OntoDM becoming an ontology that systematically describes not only data mining, but also network analysis. We believe that this work will encourage other researchers working in the filed to provide additional insight and further improve the integration of this field into OntoDM."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_stopar_multiscale_methodology/,"This paper presents a novel, multi-scale, framework, for the simultaneous analysis of multiple data streams, called StreamStory. The framework models the data streams as a hierarchical Markovian model by automatically learning states and transitios, and aggregating them into a hierarchy of Markov chains. This approach aims to compensate the gap between lowlevel streaming observations and high-level output/alerts which provide a value for higher levels of streaming data analysis, like inference and prediction, and provides ground for qualitative interpretation of the data."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_valmarska_inverted_heuristics/,"In rule learning, rules are typically induced in two phases, rule refinement and rule selection. It was recently argued that the usage of two separate heuristics for each phase—in particular using the so-called inverted heuristic in the refinement phase—produces longer rules with comparable classifi- cation accuracy. In this paper we test the utility of inverted heuristics in the context of subgroup discovery. For this purpose we developed a DoubleBeam subgroup discovery algorithm that allows for combining various heuristics for rule refinement and selection. The algorithm was experimentally evaluated on 20 UCI datasets using 10-fold double-loop cross validation. The experimental results suggest that a variant of the DoubleBeam algorithm using a specific combination of refinement and selection heuristics generates longer rules without compromising rule quality. However, the DoubleBeam algorithm using inverted heuristics does not outperform the standard CN2-SD and SD algorithms."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_kenda_energy_scenarios/,"Fusing heterogeneous multivariate data in stream mining scenarios is a demanding task. Successful fusion requires a wellthought approach. We propose the use of a stream processing engine (SPE) that enables implementation of all the needed methods and ensures almost real-time responsiveness of the system. In the paper we propose an infrastructure that is able to receive data from various heterogeneous sources (static properties, weather data and forecasts, other forecasts, and primarily sensor data). In the implementation of the proposed infrastructure we address issues related to the heterogeneous nature of the data, like different frequency, different update interval, and different nature of the data. The pipeline was used to prepare stream prediction models for five different energy-related use cases, which include public buildings, a thermal plant production, university campus buildings, and EPEX energy spot market prices alongside the total traded energy."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_moraru_forecasting_sales/,"Smart cities are an important topic in today’s research problems, with high impact in many domains from economy to transportation, health and living style. The problem addressed in this paper is that of sales forecasting for a specific category of products. We present the results of three regression algorithms, applies on real live data, for predicting the cumulative hourly sales of petrol. The prediction is made for three short term intervals, of 1, 4, and 8 hours into the future. A study has also been conducted in order to identify the amount of historical data required for optimal results."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_costa_topological_data/,"Influenzanet is a system to monitor the activity of influenza-like-illness [ILI] with the aid of internet volunteers. Topological data analysis [TDA] examines the structure of data and contributes to the development of medicine, studying properties of a continuous space by the analysis of a discrete sample of it. Using TDA we analyze the topology of Influenzanet data identifying noise and distinguishing higher dimension features. This is done both in terms of the overall structure of a disease as well as its evolution. It provides a way to test agreement at a global scale arising from standard local models. We also compare this qualitative method to other quantitative methods such as Fourier analysis or dynamical time warping [DTW]."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2015_breskvar_alzheimer_patients/,"This paper presents experiments with Predictive Clustering Trees that uncover several subpopulations of the Alzheimer’s disease patients. Our experiments are based on previous research that identified the everyday cognition as one of the most important testing domains in the clinical diagnostic process for the Alzheimer’s disease. We are investigating which biological features have a role in the progression of the disease by observing behavioral response of the patients and their study partners. Our dataset includes 342 male and 317 female patients from the ADNI database that are described with 243 clinical and biological attributes. The resulting clusters, described in terms of biological features, show behavioral and gender specific differences between clusters of patients with progressed disease. These findings suggest a possibility that the Alzheimer’s disease is manifested through different biological pathways."
