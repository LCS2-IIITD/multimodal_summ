Thus, the same smile may signal something very different when shown in response to the success of another person or their failure. In human interactions context is often implicitly described by the normative expectations that people have with regard to an event and the likely reactions of the protagonists. These expectations also vary with culture. Thus, the same expressions may be expected and appropriate in one cultural context but less appropriate in another. In this presentation I discuss the impact of context and culture for the social signals that are transmitted through emotion expressions."
http://videolectures.net/fgconference2015_morency_human_communication/,"Human face-to-face communication is a little like a dance, in that participants continuously adjust their behaviors based on verbal and nonverbal cues from the social context. Todayâ€™s computers and interactive devices are still lacking many of these human-like abilities to hold fluid and natural interactions. Multimodal machine learning addresses this challenge of creating algorithms and computational models able to analyze, recognize and predict human subtle communicative behaviors in social context. I formalize this new research endeavor with a Human Communication Dynamics framework, addressing four key computational challenges: behavioral dynamic, multimodal dynamic, interpersonal dynamic and societal dynamic. Central to this research effort is the introduction of new probabilistic models able to learn the temporal and fine-grained latent dependencies across behaviors, modalities and interlocutors. In this talk, I will present some of our recent achievements modeling multiple aspects of human communication dynamics, motivated by applications in healthcare (depression, PTSD, suicide, autism), education (learning analytics), business (negotiation, interpersonal skills) and social multimedia (opinion mining, social influence)."
