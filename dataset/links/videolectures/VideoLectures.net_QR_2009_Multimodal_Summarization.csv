Unveiling the salient physical events that underly a functional image is most appropriately addressed by feature extraction methods that exploit the domain-specific knowledge combined with spatial relations at multiple abstraction levels and scales. The identification of specific patterns that are known to characterize classes of pathologies provides an important support to the diagnosis of disturbances, and the assessment of organ functions. In this work we focus on Electrocardiographic diagnosis based on epicardial activation fields. This kind of data, which can now be obtained non invasively from body surface data through mathematical model-based reconstruction methods, can hit electrical conduction pathologies that routine surface ECGs may miss. However, their analysis/interpretation still requires highly specialized skills that belong to few experts. Given an epicardial activation field, the automated detection of salient patterns in it, grounded on the existing interpretation rationale, would represent a major contribution towards the clinical use of such valuable tools whose diagnostic potential is still largely unexplored. We focus on epicardial activation isochronal maps, which convey information about the heart electric function in terms of the depolarization wavefront kinematics. An approach grounded on the integration of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) method with concepts borrowed from Computational Geometry provides a computational framework to extract, from the given activation data, a few basic features that characterize the wavefront propagation, as well as a more specific set of diagnostic features that identify an important class of heart rhythm pathologies, namely reentry arrhythmias due to block of conduction. Keywords: Biomedical imaging; functional imaging; image based diagnosis; spatial aggregation; computational geometry; electrocardiography; cardiac electrical function."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_lovett_chl/,"A core problem in spatial reasoning is finding an appropriate set of relationships to compute. This paper proposes that humans represent topological relationships between 2D regions using three basic, qualitative relations: contains, intersects, and overlaps-with. We show how these relations can be computed from sketched inputs using a model of mid-level perception. Results from a pilot experiment indicate that these three relationships suffice to explain people‟s judgments on four English spatial terms (“intersects”, “overlaps”, “connects to”, and “contains”), although a combination of the three is generally required for each term."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_bhatt_cid/,"Spatial changes within an environment are typically a result of interaction— actions and events— occurring within. Reasoning about such changes, when dealt with formally within the context of qualitative spatial calculi and logics of action and change, poses several difficulties along multiple dimensions: (a) phenomenal requirements stemming from the dynamic nature of the spatial system (e.g., appearing and disappearing objects), (b) reasoning requirements (e.g., abductive explanation), (c) domain-independent or epistemological (e.g., persistence, ramification), and (d) aspects concerning the need to satisfy the intrinsic (axiomatic) properties of the spatial calculi (e.g., compositional consistency) being modelled. This paper, encompassing the phenomenal and reasoning aspects in (a) and (b) respectively, presents some instances that demonstrate the role of commonsense reasoning and the non-monotonic inference patterns it necessitates whilst representing and reasoning about dynamic spatial systems in general."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_kleer_fe/,"Envisioning has been used extensively to model behavior of physical systems. Envisioning generates the qualitatively distinct possible behaviors without numerically simulating every possible set of input conditions and model parameters. This paper applies envisioning to analyze course of action (COA) diagrams to determine the qualitatively distinct outcomes of military operations. In order to avoid the combinatorial explosion of possible states, this envisioner factors non-interacting units into separate envisionment threads. The envisioner uses Assumption-Based Truth Maintenance to further limit combinatorial explosion and estimate probability of outcomes.We illustrate the performance of the factored envisioner on a variety of examples provided by military experts. We analyze its scaling performance and demonstrate its ability to track operations from sparse observations."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_wetzel_acs/,"Designers often use a series of sketches to explain how their design goes through different states or modes to achieve its intended function. Learning how to create such explanations turns out to be a difficult problem for engineering students. An au-tomated ―crash test dummy‖ to let students practice explanations would be desirable. This paper de-scribes how to carry out a core piece of the reason-ing needed in such system. We show how an open-domain sketch understanding system can be used to enter many aspects of such explanations, and how qualitative mechanics can be used to check the plausibility of the intended state transitions. The system is evaluated using a corpus of sketches based on designs from an engineering school de-sign & communications course."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_friedman_lrq/,"Building models of the physical world from examples is an important challenge for qualitative reasoning systems. We describe a system that can learn intuitive models of physical behaviors from a corpus of multimodal, multi-state stimuli, consisting of sketches and text. The system extracts and temporally encodes exemplars from the stimuli and uses analogical generalization to abstract prototypical behaviors. Using statistical analysis, the system parameterizes these abstractions into qualitative representations for reasoning. We show that the explanations the system provides for new situations are consistent with those given by naïve students. Keywords: Cognitive modeling; conceptual change; misconceptions; naïve physics; qualitative reasoning"
http://videolectures.net/qr09_horiguchi_iag/,"In science education, it is important to sequence a set of microworlds (which means a system and its model limited from educational viewpoint) of various complexity adaptively to the context of learning. We previously proposed Graph of Microworlds (GMW), a framework for indexing a set of microworlds based on their models. By using GMW, it is possible to adaptively select the microworld a student should learn next, and to assist him in transferring between microworlds. However, it isn’t easy to describe GMW because an author must have the expertise in the process of modeling. In this research, we propose a method for semi-automating the description of GMW by introducing the compositional modeling mechanism. Our method assists an author in generating a set of indexed microworlds and also in considering educational meanings of the relations between them. We present how to design such a function and also illustrate how it works. A preliminary test with a prototype system showed the effectiveness of our method."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_salles_aqr/,"Regarding the education of deaf students (in Brazil), three conditions have to be met in order to bring qualitative reasoning (QR) models into the classroom: (a) a bilingual education should be provided, the Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) being the first and Portuguese the second language; (b) in the absence of scientific vocabulary in LIBRAS, it has to be created; (c) given the aural impairment, which is cognitively compensated through an over-developed visual ability, a visually oriented pedagogy is needed. This paper describes how qualitative reasoning may provide an adequate scenario to create a vocabulary in sign language for representing scientific concepts while offering support for the integration of visually-oriented models and simulations, and written Portuguese in educational activities. Key words: qualitative models, deaf, science education"
http://videolectures.net/qr09_velasco_cdr/,"The syntax, semantics and an axiom system for an extension of Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) for order of magnitude qualitative reasoning which formalizes the concepts of closeness and distance is introduced in this paper. In doing this, we use some of the advantages of PDL: firstly, we exploit the possibility of constructing complex relations from simpler ones for defining the concept of closeness and other programming commands such as while . . . do and repeat . . . until; secondly, we employ its theoretical support in order to show that the satisfiability problem is decidable. Moreover, the specific axioms of our logic have been obtained from the minimal set of formulas needed in our definition of qualitative sum of small, medium and large numbers. We also present some of the advantages of our approach on the basis of an example."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_cerepnalkoski_iqe/,"This paper explores the possibility of extending Processbased models with Qualitative differential equations. Process-based modeling is a modeling technique that uses two-level approach for modeling dynamical systems. It models systems on a purely qualitative level in terms of entities and processes that involve those entities on one hand, and a quantitative level on which all entities and processes are given a quantitative formulation which is that automatically translated into a set of ordinary differential equations. This paper aims to illustrate that this formalism can be extended with an intermediate level of modeling which consists of qualitative equations."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_rosello_uqr/,"Ordinal scales are commonly used in rating and evaluation processes. These processes usually involve group decision making by means of an experts’ committee. In this paper a mathematical framework based on the qualitative model of the absolute orders of magnitude is considered. The entropy of a qualitatively described system is defined in this framework. On the one hand, this enables us to measure the amount of information provided by each evaluator and, on the other hand, the coherence of the evaluation committee. The new approach is capable of managing situations where the assessment given by experts involves different levels of precision. The use of the proposed measures within an automatic system for group decision making will contribute towards avoiding the potential subjectivity caused by conflicts of interests of the evaluators in the group."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_liem_mbe/,"Capturing conceptual knowledge in QR models is becoming of interest to a larger audience of domain experts. Consequently, we have been training several groups to effectively create QR models during the last few years. In this paper we describe our teaching experiences, the issues the modellers encountered and the solutions to solve them in the form of reusable patterns, and finally a structured way to debug models."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_forbus_dkq/,"While people do qualitative reasoning, there is ample evidence that they do not always do it well. Two current crises, human-induced climate change and the financial meltdown, can be traced in part to faulty mental models. The QR community has formalisms that can potentially help with public education about such problems, but so far we have not been very successful in doing so. We claim that part of the reason is that current QR accounts do not adequately incorporate experiential knowledge. We argue that it is important to find better ways to improve public qualitative reasoning abilities, in part by helping people enlist their experience-based models via analogy."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_shen_omb/,"Combating identity fraud is crucial and urgent as false identity has become the common denominator of all serious crime, including mafia trafficking and terrorism. Typical approaches to detecting the use of false identity rely on the similarity measure of textual and other content-based characteristics, which are usually not applicable in the case of deceptive and erroneous description. This barrier can be overcome through link information presented in communication behaviors, financial interactions and social networks. Quantitative link-based similarity measures have proven effective for identifying similar problems in the Internet and publication domains. However, these numerical methods only concentrate on link structures, and fail to achieve accurate and coherent interpretation of the information. Inspired by this observation, this paper presents a novel qualitative similarity measure that makes use of multiple link properties to refine the underlying similarity estimation process and consequently derive semantic-rich similarity descriptors. The approach is based on order-of-magnitude reasoning. Its applicability and performance are experimentally evaluated over a terrorism-related dataset, and further generalized with publication data."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_dehghani_qcm/,"Qualitative representations have proven to be useful formalisms for capturing human mental models. As a result, qualitative modeling could become an important tool for cognitive science. Specifically, an environment in which qualitative representations can be used to explore mental models and different type of reasoning and simulations can be performed on these models can be a useful tool for cognitive scientists. In this paper, we introduce the Qualitative Concept Map system, designed for cognitive scientists, for building and simulating qualitative and Bayesian models using qualitative process theory and Bayesian inference."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_strle_qad/,"Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a method for calculating the similarity between two time series which can occur at different times or speeds. Although its effectiveness made it very popular in several disciplines, its time complexity of O(N2) makes it useful only for relatively short time series. In this paper, we propose a qualitative approximation Qualitative Dynamic Time Warping (QDTW) to DTW. QDTW reduces a time series length by transforming it to qualitative time series. DTW is later calculated between qualitative time series. As qualitative time series are normally much shorter than their corresponding numerical time series, time to compute their similarity is significantly reduced. Experimental results have shown improved running time of up to three orders of magnitude, while prediction accuracy only slightly decreased."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_noble_qms/,"A qualitative model was developed in Garp3 to capture and formalise knowledge about river rehabilitation and the management of an Atlantic salmon population. The model integrates information about the ecology of the salmon life cycle, the environmental factors that may limit the survival of key life stages and links with human activities such as agriculture, habitat rehabilitation and fishing. The overall aim of the model was to explore the effects of rehabilitation in the context of a complete life cycle scenario. The scenarios and simulations produced were able to explore these processes in the context of a complete life cycle, but at this scale the simulations were time consuming. Therefore, in addition to these scenarios a series of smaller demonstrator scenarios were developed that succinctly explored individual concepts within the system."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_zitek_epq/,"This paper presents the potential use of Qualitative Reasoning (QR) to capture and communicate knowledge on sustainable catchment management. Based on a case study, qualitative models dealing with issues of a sustainable development of riverine landscapes were developed and implemented using the Garp3 software following a general modeling framework. The evaluation of the models and the QR approach by students and experts revealed the high potential of QR models to capture and communicate complex knowledge in an understandable and interesting manner, mainly due to the ability of the presented approach to capture qualitative system dynamics and integrate ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ facts in a structured way. In the future a library of expert models might serve as an important source of information for both, education and management."
http://videolectures.net/qr09_salles_aei/,"How to feed the world without loosing what is left of biodiversity? Two answers for this question are found in the literature. On the one hand, the “Land Sparing” paradigm suggests that increasing yield by means of intensive agricultural systems would fulfill the needs of human population and save natural landscapes. On the other hand, “Biodiversity Friendly Farming” argues that agricultural intensification has deep impacts on both biodiversity and ecosystem properties and suggests that non-intensive farming practices keep the ecological balance and still may produce large quantities of high quality food (food security). This work presents a Qualitative Reasoning (QR) model that compares the impacts of intensive and non-intensive agriculture on water resources, biodiversity and productivity. The simulations show the inefficiency of intensive agriculture in protecting water resources and biodiversity, and the efficiency of non-intensive approach in terms of food production and ecosystem conservation."
