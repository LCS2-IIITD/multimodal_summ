http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_faloutsos_mbg/,"What do graphs look like? How do they evolve over time? How to handle a graph with a billion nodes? We present a comprehensive list of static and temporal laws, and some recent observations on real graphs (like, e.g., “eigenSpokes”). For generators, we describe some recent ones, which naturally match all of the known properties of real graphs. Finally, for tools, we present “oddBall” for discovering anomalies and patterns, as well as an overview of the PEGASUS system which is designed for handling Billion-node graphs, running on top of the “hadoop” system."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_shum_bdm/,"The decade-old Internet search outcomes, manifested in the form of “ten blue links,” are no longer sufficient for Internet users. Many studies have shown that when users are ushered off the conventional search result pages through blue links, their needs are often partially met at best in a “hit-or-miss” fashion. To tackle this challenge, we have designed Bing, Microsoft’s decision engine, to not just navigate users to a landing page through a blue link but to continue engaging with users to clarify intent and facilitate task completion. Underlying this new paradigm is the Bing Dialog Model that consists of three building blocks: an indexing system that comprehensively collects information from the web and systematically harvests knowledge, an intent model that statistically infers user intent and predicts next action, and an interaction model that elicits user intent through mathematically optimized presentations of web information and domain knowledge that matches user needs. In this talk, I’ll describe Bing Dialog Model in details and demonstrate it in action through some innovative features since the launch of www.Bing.com"
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_weber_wuw/,"We analyze a large query log of 2.3 million anonymous registered users from a web-scale U.S. search engine in order to jointly analyze their on-line behavior in terms of who they might be (demographics), what they search for (query topics), and how they search (session analysis). We examine basic demographics from registration information provided by the users, augmented with U.S. census data, analyze basic session statistics, classify queries into types (navigational, informational, transactional) based on click entropy, classify queries into topic categories, and cluster users based on the queries they issued. We then examine the resulting clusters in terms of demographics and search behavior. Our analysis of the data suggests that there are important differences in search behavior across different demographic groups in terms of the topics they search for, and how they search (e.g., white conservatives are those likely to have voted republican, mostly white males, who search for business, home, and gardening related topics; Baby Boomers tend to be primarily interested in Finance and a large fraction of their sessions consist of simple navigational queries related to online banking, etc.). Finally, we examine regional search differences, which seem to correlate with differences in local industries (e.g., gambling related queries are highest in Las Vegas and lowest in Salt Lake City; searches related to actors are about three times higher in L.A. than in any other region)."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_matthijs_pws/,"Personalizing web search results has long been recognized as an avenue to greatly improve the search experience. We present a personalization approach that builds a user interest profile using users' complete browsing behavior, then uses this model to rerank web results. We show that using a combination of content and previously visited websites provides effective personalization. We extend previous work by proposing a number of techniques for filtering previously viewed content that greatly improve the user model used for personalization. Our approaches are compared to previous work in offline experiments and are evaluated against unpersonalized web search in large scale online tests. Large improvements are found in both cases."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_teevan_tsc/,"Social networking Web sites are not just places to maintain relationships; they can also be valuable information sources. However, little is known about how and why people search socially-generated content. In this paper we explore search behavior on the popular microblogging/social networking site Twitter. Using analysis of large-scale query logs and supplemental qualitative data, we observe that people search Twitter to find temporally relevant information (e.g., breaking news, real-time content, and popular trends) and information related to people (e.g., content directed at the searcher, information about people of interest, and general sentiment and opinion). Twitter queries are shorter, more popular, and less likely to evolve as part of a session than Web queries. It appears people repeat Twitter queries to monitor the associated search results, while changing and developing Web queries to learn about a topic. The results returned from the different corpora support these different uses, with Twitter results including more social chatter and social events, and Web results containing more basic facts and navigational content. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of next-generation Web search tools that incorporate social media."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_pal_ita/,"Content in microblogging systems such as Twitter is produced by tens to hundreds of millions of users. This diversity is a notable strength, but also presents the challenge of finding the most interesting and authoritative authors for any given topic. To address this, we first propose a set of features for characterizing social media authors, including both nodal and topical metrics. We then show how probabilistic clustering over this feature space, followed by a within-cluster ranking procedure, can yield a final list of top authors for a given topic. We present results across several topics, along with results from a user study confirming that our method finds authors who are significantly more interesting and authoritative than those resulting from several baseline conditions. Additionally our algorithm is computationally feasible in near real-time scenarios making it an attractive alternative for capturing the rapidly changing dynamics of microblogs."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_leskovec_cmd/,"Transmission of infectious diseases, propagation of information, and spread of ideas and influence through social networks are all examples of diffusion. In such cases we say that a contagion spreads through the network, a process that can be modeled by a cascade graph. Studying cascades and network diffusion is challenging due to missing data. Even a single missing observation in a sequence of propagation events can significantly alter our inferences about the diffusion process. We address the problem of missing data in information cascades. Specifically, given only a fraction C′ of the complete cascade C, our goal is to estimate the properties of the complete cascade C, such as its size or depth. To estimate the properties of C, we first formulate k-tree model of cascades and analytically study its properties in the face of missing data. We then propose a numerical method that given a cascade model and observed cascade C′ can estimate properties of the complete cascade C. We evaluate our methodology using information propagation cascades in the Twitter network (70 million nodes and 2 billion edges), as well as information cascades arising in the blogosphere. Our experiments show that the k-tree model is an effective tool to study the effects of missing data in cascades. Most importantly, we show that our method (and the k-tree model) can accurately estimate properties of the complete cascade C even when 90% of the data is missing."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_mason_iit/,"Word-of-mouth diffusion of information is of great interest to planners, marketers and social network researchers alike. In this work we investigate the attributes and relative influence of 1.6M Twitter users by tracking 39 million diffusion events that took place on the Twitter follower graph over a two month interval in 2009. We find that the largest cascades tend to be generated by users who have been influential in the past and from URLs that were rated more interesting and/or elicited more positive feelings by workers on Mechanical Turk. However, individual-level predictions of which user or URL will generate large cascades are relatively unreliable. We conclude, therefore, that word-of-mouth diffusion can only be harnessed reliably by targeting large numbers of potential influencers, thereby capturing average effects. Finally, we consider a family of hypothetical marketing strategies, and find that under a wide range of plausible assumptions the most cost-effective performance can be realized using ""ordinary influencers"" - individuals who exert average or even less-than-average influence."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_craswell_cac/,"Traditional editorial effectiveness measures, such as nDCG, remain standard for Web search evaluation. Unfortunately, these traditional measures can inappropriately reward redundant information and can fail to reflect the broad range of user needs that can underlie a Web query. To address these deficiencies, several researchers have recently proposed effectiveness measures for novelty and diversity. Many of these measures are based on simple cascade models of user behavior, which operate by considering the relationship between successive elements of a result list. The properties of these measures are still poorly understood, and it is not clear from prior research that they work as intended. In this paper we examine the properties and performance of cascade measures with the goal of validating them as tools for measuring effectiveness. We explore their commonalities and differences, placing them in a unified framework; we discuss their theoretical difficulties and limitations, and compare the measures experimentally, contrasting them against traditional measures and against other approaches to measuring novelty. Data collected by the TREC 2009 Web Track is used as the basis for our experimental comparison. Our results indicate that these measures reward systems that achieve an balance between novelty and overall precision in their result lists, as intended. Nonetheless, other measures provide insights not captured by the cascade measures, and we suggest that future evaluation efforts continue to report a variety of measures."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_teevan_upp/,"This paper presents an algorithm that predicts with very high accuracy which Web search result a user will click for one sixth of all Web queries. Prediction is done via a straightforward form of personalization that takes advantage of the fact that people often use search engines to re-find previously viewed resources. In our approach, an individual’s past navigational behavior is identified via query log analysis and used to forecast identical future navigational behavior by the same individual. We compare the potential value of personal navigation with general navigation identified using aggregate user behavior. Although consistent navigational behavior across users can be useful for identifying a subset of navigational queries, different people often use the same queries to navigate to different resources. This is true even for queries comprised of unambiguous company names or URLs and typically thought of as navigational. We build an understanding of what personal navigation looks like, and identify ways to improve its coverage and accuracy by taking advantage of people’s consistency over time and across groups of individuals."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_bendersky_qbr/,"Many existing retrieval approaches do not take into account the content quality of the retrieved documents, although link-based measures such as PageRank are commonly used as a form of document prior. In this paper, we present the quality-biased ranking method that promotes documents containing high-quality content, and penalizes low-quality documents. The quality of the document content can be determined by its readability, layout and ease-of-navigation, among other factors. Accordingly, instead of using a single estimate for document quality, we consider multiple content- based features that are directly integrated into a state-of- the-art retrieval method. These content-based features are easy to compute, store and retrieve, even for large web collections. We use several query sets and web collections to empirically evaluate the performance of our quality-biased retrieval method. In each case, our method consistently improves by a large margin the retrieval performance of text- based and link-based retrieval methods that do not take into account the quality of the document content."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_radinsky_rfp/,"Obtaining judgments from human raters is a vital part in the design of search engines’ evaluation. Today, there exists a discrepancy between judgment acquisition from raters (training phase) and use of the responses for retrieval evaluation (evaluation phase). This discrepancy is derived from the inconsistency between the representation of the information in both phases. During training, raters are requested to provide a relevance score for an individual result in the context of a query, whereas the evaluation is performed on ordered lists of search results, with the results’ relative position (compared to other results) is taken into account. As an alternative to the practice of learning to rank using relevance judgments for individual search results, more and more focus has recently been diverted to the theory and practice of learning from answers to combinatorial questions about sets of search results. That is, users, during training, are asked to rank small sets (typically pairs). We start by statistically comparing human rater response to questions on relevance of individual results versus questions on pairs of results. We empirically show that neither type of response can be deduced from the other, and that the added context created when results are shown together changes raters’ evaluation process. Since pairwise judgments are directly related to ranking, we conclude they are more accurate for that purpose. We go beyond pairs to show that triplets do not contain significantly much more information than pairs for the purpose of measuring statistical preference. These two results establish good stability properties of pairwise comparisons for the purpose of learning to rank. We further analyze different scenarios, in which results of varying quality are added as “decoy”. A recurring source of worry in papers focusing on pairwise comparison is the quadratic number of pairs in a set of results. Which preferences do we choose to solicit from paid raters? Can we provably eliminate a quadratic cost? We initiate a rigorous statistical learning theoretical study in the question of which and how many pairs we need to choose, and prove a result indicating that only O(n polylog n) pairs are required in order to obtain an almost perfect ordering. These pairs are chosen adaptively, and hence our scheme suggests an active learning algorithm."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_huston_eir/,"The identification of repeated n-gram phrases in text has many practical applications, including authorship attribution, text reuse identification, and plagiarism detection. We consider methods for finding the repeated n-grams in text corpora, with emphasis on techniques that can be effectively scaled across a cluster of processors to handle very large amounts of text. We compare our proposed method to existing techniques using the 1.5 TB TREC ClueWeb-B text collection, using both single-processor and multi-processor approaches. The experiments show that our method offers an important tradeoff between speed and temporary storage space, and provides an alternative to previous approaches that scales almost linearly in the length of the sequence, is largely independent of n, and provides a uniform workload balance across the set of available processors."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_ding_pvs/,"Large web search engines are now processing billions of queries per day. Most of these queries are interactive in nature, requiring a response in fractions of a second. However, there are also a number of important scenarios where large batches of queries are submitted for various web mining and system optimization tasks that do not require an immediate response. Given the significant cost of executing search queries over billions of web pages, it is a natural question to ask if such batches of queries can be more efficiently executed than interactive queries. In this paper, we motivate and discuss the problem of batch query processing in search engines, identify basic mechanisms for improving the performance of such queries, and provide a preliminary experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques. Our conclusion is that significant cost reductions are possible by using specialized mechanisms for executing batch queries in Web search engines."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_radlinski_duc/,"The web contains many duplicate and near-duplicate documents. Given that user satisfaction is negatively affected by redundant information in search results, a significant amount of research has been devoted to developing duplicate detection algorithms. However, most such algorithms rely solely on document content to detect duplication, ignoring the fact that a primary goal of duplicate detection is to identify documents that contain redundant information with respect to a particular user query. Similarly, although query-dependent result diversification algorithms compute a query-dependent ranking, they tend to do so on the basis of a query-independent content similarity score. In this paper, we bridge the gap between query-dependent redundancy and query-independent duplication by showing how user click behavior following a query provides evidence about the relative novelty of web documents. While most previous work on interpreting user clicks on search results has assumed that they reflect just result relevance, we show that clicks also provide information about duplication between web documents since users consider search results in the context of previously seen documents. Moreover, we find that duplication explains a substantial amount of presentation bias observed in clicking behavior. We identify three distinct types of redundancy that commonly occur on the web and show how click data can be used to detect these different types."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_mass_kmv/,"The problem of fully decentralized search over many collections is considered. The objective is to approximate the results of centralized search (namely, using a central index) while controlling the communication cost and involving only a small number of collections. The proposed solution is couched in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, but can also be applied in other setups. Peers publish per-term summaries of their collections. Specifically, for each term, the range of document scores is divided into intervals; and for each interval, a KMV (K Minimal Values) synopsis of its documents is created. A new peer-selection algorithm uses the KMV synopses and two scoring functions in order to adaptively rank the peers, according to the relevance of their documents to a given query. The proposed method achieves high-quality results while meeting the above criteria of efficiency. In particular, experiments are done on two large, real-world datasets; one is blogs and the other is web data. These experiments show that the algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and is robust over different collections, various scoring functions and multi-term queries."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_svore_utq/,"Web search is strongly influenced by time. The queries people issue change over time, with some queries occasionally spiking in popularity (e.g., earthquake) and others remaining relatively constant (e.g., youtube). The documents indexed by the search engine also change, with some documents always being about a particular query (e.g., the Wikipedia page on earthquakes is about the query earthquake) and others being about the query only at a particular point in time (e.g., the New York Times is only about earthquakes following a major seismic activity). The relationship between documents and queries can also change as people's intent changes (e.g., people sought different content for the query earthquake before the Haitian earthquake than they did after). In this paper, we explore how queries, their associated documents, and the query intent change over the course of 10 weeks by analyzing query log data, a daily Web crawl, and periodic human relevance judgments. We identify several interesting features by which changes to query popularity can be classified, and show that presence of these features, when accompanied by changes in result content, can be a good indicator of change in query intent."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_yang_tvo/,"Online content exhibits rich temporal dynamics, and diverse realtime user generated content further intensifies this process. However, temporal patterns by which online content grows and fades over time, and by which different pieces of content compete for attention remain largely unexplored. We study temporal patterns associated with online content and how the content’s popularity grows and fades over time. The attention that content receives on the Web varies depending on many factors and occurs on very different time scales and at different resolutions. In order to uncover the temporal dynamics of online content we formulate a time series clustering problem using a similarity metric that is invariant to scaling and shifting. We develop the K-Spectral Centroid (K-SC) clustering algorithm that effectively finds cluster centroids with our similarity measure. By applying an adaptive wavelet-based incremental approach to clustering, we scale K-SC to large data sets. We demonstrate our approach on two massive datasets: a set of 580 million Tweets, and a set of 170 million blog posts and news media articles. We find that K-SC outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm in finding distinct shapes of time series. Our analysis shows that there are six main temporal shapes of attention of online content. We also present a simple model that reliably predicts the shape of attention by using information about only a small number of participants. Our analyses offer insight into common temporal patterns of the content on theWeb and broaden the understanding of the dynamics of human attention."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_sakai_ugr/,"Community Question Answering (CQA) sites such as Yahoo! Answers have emerged as rich knowledge resources for information seekers. However, answers posted to CQA sites can be irrelevant, incomplete, redundant, incorrect, biased, ill-formed or even abusive. Hence, automatic selection of ""good"" answers for a given posted question is a practical research problem that will help us manage the quality of accumulated knowledge. One way to evaluate answer selection systems for CQA would be to use the Best Answers (BAs) that are readily available from the CQA sites. However, BAs may be biased, and even if they are not, there may be other good answers besides BAs. To remedy these two problems, we propose system evaluation methods that involve multiple answer assessors and graded-relevance information retrieval metrics. Our main findings from experiments using the NTCIR-8 CQA task data are that, using our evaluation methods, (a) we can detect many substantial differences between systems that would have been overlooked by BA-based evaluation; and (b) we can better identify hard questions (i.e. those that are handled poorly by many systems and therefore require focussed investigation) compared to BAbased evaluation. We therefore argue that our approach is useful for building effective CQA answer selection systems despite the cost of manual answer assessments."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_hoi_msi/,"With the popularity of various social media applications, massive social images associated with high quality tags have been made available in many social media web sites nowadays. Mining social images on the web has become an emerging important research topic in web search and data mining. In this paper, we propose a machine learning framework for mining social images and investigate its application to automated image tagging. To effectively discover knowledge from social images that are often associated with multimodal contents (including visual images and textual tags), we propose a novel Unified Distance Metric Learning (UDML) scheme, which not only exploits both visual and textual contents of social images, but also effectively unifies both inductive and transductive metric learning techniques in a systematic learning framework. We further develop an efficient stochastic gradient descent algorithm for solving the UDML optimization task and prove the convergence of the algorithm. By applying the proposed technique to the automated image tagging task in our experiments, we demonstrate that our technique is empirically effective and promising for mining social images towards some real applications."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_sarma_dre/,"This paper studies the problem of dynamic relationship and event discovery. A large body of previous work on relation extraction focuses on discovering predefined and static relationships between entities. In contrast, we aim to identify temporally defined (e.g., co-bursting) relationships that are not predefined by an existing schema, and we identify the underlying time constrained events that lead to these relationships. The key challenges in identifying such events include discovering and verifying dynamic connections among entities, and consolidating binary dynamic connections into events consisting of a set of entities that are connected at a given time period. We formalize this problem and introduce an efficient end-to-end pipeline as a solution. In particular, we introduce two formal notions, global temporal constraint cluster and local temporal constraint cluster, for detecting dynamic events. We further design efficient algorithms for discovering such events from a large graph of dynamic relationships. Finally, detailed experiments on real data show the effectiveness of our proposed solution."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_gupta_jto/,"We consider the problem of jointly training structured models for extraction from multiple web sources whose records enjoy partial content overlap. This has important applications in open-domain extraction, e.g. a user materializing a table of interest from multiple relevant unstructured sources; or a site like Freebase augmenting an incomplete relation by extracting more rows from web sources. Such applications require extraction over arbitrary domains, so one cannot use a pre-trained extractor or demand a huge labeled dataset. We propose to overcome this lack of supervision by using content overlap across the related web sources. Existing methods of exploiting overlap have been developed under settings that do not generalize easily to the scale and diversity of overlap seen on Web sources. We present an agreement-based learning framework that jointly trains the models by biasing them to agree on the agreement regions, i.e. shared text segments. We present alternatives within our framework to trade-off tractability, robustness to noise, and extent of agreement enforced; and propose a scheme of partitioning agreement regions that leads to efficient training while maximizing overall accuracy. Further, we present a principled scheme to discover low-noise agreement regions in unlabeled data across multiple sources. Through extensive experiments over 58 different extraction domains, we establish that our framework provides significant boosts over uncoupled training, and scores over alternatives such as collective inference, staged training, and multi-view learning."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_nakashole_skh/,"Harvesting relational facts from Web sources has received great attention for automatically constructing large knowledge bases. Stateof-the-art approaches combine pattern-based gathering of fact candidates with constraint-based reasoning. However, they still face major challenges regarding the trade-offs between precision, recall, and scalability. Techniques that scale well are susceptible to noisy patterns that degrade precision, while techniques that employ deep reasoning for high precision cannot cope with Web-scale data. This paper presents a scalable system, called PROSPERA, for high-quality knowledge harvesting. We propose a new notion of ngram-itemsets for richer patterns, and use MaxSat-based constraint reasoning on both the quality of patterns and the validity of fact candidates.We compute pattern-occurrence statistics for two benefits: they serve to prune the hypotheses space and to derive informative weights of clauses for the reasoner. The paper shows how to incorporate these building blocks into a scalable architecture that can parallelize all phases on a Hadoop-based distributed platform. Our experiments with the ClueWeb09 corpus include comparisons to the recent ReadTheWeb experiment. We substantially outperform these prior results in terms of recall, with the same precision, while having low run-times."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_kotov_mne/,"In this work, we study a new text mining problem of discovering named entities with temporally correlated bursts of mention counts in multiple multilingual Web news streams. Mining named entities with temporally correlated bursts of mention counts in multilingual text streams has many interesting and important applications, such as identification of the latent events, attracting the attention of on-line media in different countries, and valuable linguistic knowledge in the form of transliterations. While mining ""bursty"" terms in a single text stream has been studied before, the problem of detecting terms with temporally correlated bursts in multilingual Web streams raises two new challenges: (i) correlated terms in multiple streams may have bursts that are of different orders of magnitude in their intensity and (ii) bursts of correlated terms may be separated by time gaps. We propose a two-stage method for mining items with temporally correlated bursts from multiple data streams, which addresses both challenges. In the first stage of the method, the temporal behavior of different entities is normalized by modeling them with the Markov-Modulated Poisson Process. In the second stage, a dynamic programming algorithm is used to discover correlated bursts of different items, that can be potentially separated by time gaps. We evaluated our method with the task of discovering transliterations of named entities from multilingual Web news streams. Experimental results indicate that our method can not only effectively discover named entities with correlated bursts in multilingual Web news streams, but also outperforms two state-of-the-art baseline methods for unsupervised discovery of transliterations in static text collections."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_joachims_drr/,"We present a theoretically well-founded retrieval model for dynamically generating rankings based on interactive user feedback. Unlike conventional rankings that remain static after the query was issued, dynamic rankings allow and anticipate user activity, thus providing a way to combine the otherwise contradictory goals of result diversification and high recall. We develop a decision-theoretic framework to guide the design and evaluation of algorithms for this interactive retrieval setting. Furthermore, we propose two dynamic ranking algorithms, both of which are computationally efficient. We prove that these algorithms provide retrieval performance that is guaranteed to be at least as good as the optimal static ranking algorithm. In empirical evaluations, dynamic ranking shows substantial improvements in retrieval performance over conventional static rankings."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_chierichetti_otd/,"Classic search engine results are presented as an ordered list of documents and the problem of presentation trivially reduces to ordering documents by their scores. This is because users scan a list presentation from top to bottom. This leads to natural list optimization measures such as the discounted cumulative gain (DCG) and the rank-biased precision (RBP). Increasingly, search engines are using two-dimensional results presentations; image and shopping search results are long-standing examples. The simplistic heuristic used in practice is to place images by row-major order in the matrix presentation. However, a variety of evidence suggests that users' scan of pages is not in this matrix order. In this paper we (1) view users' scan of a results page as a Markov chain, which yields DCG and RBP as special cases for linear lists; (2) formulate, study, and develop solutions for the problem of inferring the Markov chain from click logs; (3) from these inferred Markov chains, empirically validate folklore phenomena (e.g., the ""golden triangle"" of user scans in two dimensions); and (4) develop and experimentally compare algorithms for optimizing user utility in matrix presentations. The theory and algorithms extend naturally beyond matrix presentations."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_panigrahi_rec/,"Commerce search engines have become popular in recent years, as users increasingly search for (and buy) products on the web. In response to an user query, they surface links to products in their catalog (or index) that match the requirements specified in the query. Often, few or no product in the catalog matches the user query exactly, and the search engine is forced to return a set of products that partially match the query. This paper considers the problem of choosing a set of products in response to an user query, so as to ensure maximum user satisfaction. We call this the result enrichment problem in commerce search. The challenge in result enrichment is two-fold: the search engine needs to estimate the extent to which a user genuinely cares about an attribute that she has specified in a query; then, it must display products in the catalog that match the user requirement on the important attributes, but have a similar but possibly non-identical value on the less important ones. To this end, we propose a technique for measuring the importance of individual attribute values and the similarity between different values of an attribute. A novelty of our approach is that we use entire browse trails, rather than just clickthrough rates, in this estimation algorithm. We develop a model for this problem, propose an algorithm to solve it, and support our theoretical findings via experiments conducted on actual user data."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_tolomei_itb/,"The research challenge addressed in this paper is to devise effective techniques for identifying task-based sessions, i.e. sets of possibly non contiguous queries issued by the user of a Web Search Engine for carrying out a given task. In order to evaluate and compare different approaches, we built, by means of a manual labelling process, a ground-truth where the queries of a given query log have been grouped in tasks. Our analysis of this ground-truth shows that users tend to perform more than one task at the same time, since about 75% of the submitted queries involve a multi-tasking activity. We formally define the Task-based Session Discovery Problem (TSDP) as the problem of best approximating the manually annotated tasks, and we propose several variants of well known clustering algorithms, as well as a novel efficient heuristic algorithm, specifically tuned for solving the TSDP. These algorithms also exploit the collaborative knowledge collected by Wiktionary and Wikipedia for detecting query pairs that are not similar from a lexical content point of view, but actually semantically related. The proposed algorithms have been evaluated on the above ground-truth, and are shown to perform better than state-of-the-art approaches, because they effectively take into account the multi-tasking behavior of users."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_lyu_rss/,"Although Recommender Systems have been comprehensively analysed in the past decade, the study of social-based recommender systems just started. In this paper, aiming at providing a general method for improving recommender systems by incorporating social network information, we propose a matrix factorization framework with social regularization. The contributions of this paper are four-fold: (1) We elaborate how social network information can benefit recommender systems; (2) We interpret the differences between social-based recommender systems and trust-aware recommender systems; (3) We coin the term Social Regularization to represent the social constraints on recommender systems, and we systematically illustrate how to design a matrix factorization objective function with social regularization; and (4) The proposed method is quite general, which can be easily extended to incorporate other contextual information, like social tags, etc. The empirical analysis on two large datasets demonstrates that our approaches outperform other state-of-the-art methods."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_li_uoe/,"Contextual bandit algorithms have become popular for online recommendation systems such as Digg, Yahoo! Buzz, and news recommendation in general. Offline evaluation of the effectiveness of new algorithms in these applications is critical for protecting online user experiences but very challenging due to their ""partial-label"" nature. Common practice is to create a simulator which simulates the online environment for the problem at hand and then run an algorithm against this simulator. However, creating simulator itself is often difficult and modelling bias is usually unavoidably introduced. In this paper, we introduce a replay methodology for contextual bandit algorithm evaluation. Different from simulator-based approaches, our method is completely data-driven and very easy to adapt to different applications. More importantly, our method can provide provably unbiased evaluations. Our empirical results on a large-scale news article recommendation dataset collected from Yahoo! Front Page conform well with our theoretical results. Furthermore, comparisons between our offline replay and online bucket evaluation of several contextual bandit algorithms show accuracy and effectiveness of our offline evaluation method."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_lang_dam/,"We introduce and formalize a novel constrained path optimization problem that is the heart of the real-time ad serving task in the Yahoo! (formerly RightMedia) Display Advertising Exchange. In the Exchange, the ad server's task for each display opportunity is to compute, with low latency, an optimal valid path through a directed graph representing the business arrangements between the hundreds of thousands of business entities that are participating in the Exchange. These entities include not only publishers and advertisers, but also intermediate entities called ""ad networks"" which have delegated their ad serving responsibilities to the Exchange. Path optimality is determined by the payment to the publisher, and is affected by an advertiser's bid and also by the revenue-sharing agreements between the entities in the chosen path leading back to the publisher. Path validity is determined by constraints which focus on the following three issues: 1) suitability of the opportunity's web page and its publisher 2)suitability of the user who is currently viewing that web page, and 3) suitability of a candidate ad and its advertiser. Because the Exchange's constrained path optimization task is novel, there are no published algorithms for it. This paper describes two different algorithms that have both been successfully used in the actual Yahoo! ad server. The first algorithm has the advantage of being extremely simple, while the second is more robust thanks to its polynomial worst-case running time. In both cases, meeting latency caps has required that the basic algorithms be improved by optimizations; we will describe a candidate ordering scheme and a pre-computation scheme that have both been effective in reducing latency in the real ad serving system that serves over ten billion ad calls per day."
