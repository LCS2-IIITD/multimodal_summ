http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_kraut_doc/,"Online communities are the fastest-growing portion of the Internet and provide members with information, social support, and entertainment. While a minority, such as Wikipedia, MySpace, Facebook and the Apache Server project are highly successful, many others fail. To be successful, online communities must overcome challenges common in almost all groups, organizations and voluntary associations – solving problems of start-up, recruitment, socialization, commitment, contribution, coordination and regulation of behavior. The social sciences can tell us a lot about how to create thriving online communities. Social science theories can inform choices about how to get a community started, integrate newcomers, encourage commitment, regulate behavior when there are conflicts, motivate contributions, and coordinate those contributions to maximize benefits for the community.  This talk focuses on ways to build members’ commitment to online communities, based on theories of social identity and interpersonal bonds. It provides an overview of the relevant theory, describes results of a 6-month field experiment in which an existing site was redesigned based on principles derived from social identity and interpersonal-bond theories, and describes the results of an agent-based model that examines how different approaches to moderating the content in a group influence social identity and interpersonal bonds."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_kearns_bes/,"For four years now, we have been conducting “medium-scale” experiments in how human subjects behave in strategic and economic settings mediated by an underlying social network structure. We have explored a wide range of networks inspired by generative models from the literature, and a diverse set of collective strategic problems, including biased voting, graph coloring, consensus, and networked trading. These experiments have yielded a wealth of both specific findings and emerging general themes about how populations of human subjects interact in strategic networks. Kearns will review these findings and themes, with an emphasis on the many more questions they raise than answer. Michael Kearns is a professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania, where he holds the National Center Chair in Resource Management and Technology. He is the founding director of Penn Engineering’s new Market and Social Systems Engineering (MKSE) program. Kearns has secondary appointments in the Statistics and Op erations and Information Management (OPIM) departments of the Wharton School, and is an affiliated faculty member of Penn’s Applied Math and Computational Science graduate program. Kearns also serves as an advisor to Yodle, kaChing, Invite Media, and Kwedit. His research interests include topics in machine learning, algorithmic game theory, social networks, computational finance, and artificial intelligence. Most recently, he has been conducting human-subject experiments on strategic and economic interaction in social networks. Kearns received his B.S in mathematics and computer science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1985, and his Ph.D. in computer science from Harvard University in 1989. He has served as the program chair of NIPS, AAAI, COLT, and ACM EC. He is a member of the NIPS Foundation and the steering committee for the Snowbird Conference on Learning, and serves on the editorial board of The MIT Press series on adaptive computation and machine learning."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_pennebaker_wrp/,"Pennebaker’s research explores the links between traumatic experiences, expressive writing, natural language use, and physical and mental health. Across numerous real-world contexts, his studies have demonstrated that the words people use serve as powerful reflections of their personality and social worlds. For example, his analyses of over 1,000 people who wrote blogs in the weeks before and after September 11 terrorist attacks showed that the journal entries revealed pronounced psychological changes in response to the attacks. His talk will address the fact that most language-based computer programs analyze content-heavy words (such as nouns and regular verbs) and throw out “junk” words (such as pronouns, prepositions, and articles) to understand people’s thinking, buying, searching, and other behaviors. According to Pennebaker’s work, analyses of junk words can yield important insights into the social and psychological processes of people across cultures and languages. He will talk about his recent studies, which point to the role of junk words in identifying personality, depression, status, honesty, group cohesiveness, and other individual and group behaviors."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_watkins_ivs/,"Watkins has been researching young people’s media behaviors for more than ten years and he teaches in the departments of Radio - Television - Film and Sociology and the Center for African and African American Studies. His recent book, The Young and the Digital: What the Migration to Social Network Sites, Games, and Anytime, Anywhere Media Means for Our Future, explores young people’s dynamic engagement with social media, online games, mobile phones, and communities like Facebook and MySpace. A few short years ago Facebook was widely viewed as a site for college students who used the platform primarily for social purposes - making new friends, stalking each other, and posting pictures from a weekend of partying and drinking. Watkins’ talk will show how young people’s participation in Facebook is actually more complex than the popular images and myths suggests. Drawing from both survey data and in-depth interviews with current college students and recent college graduates the talk considers how the use of Facebook evolves across the young life-cycle. The talk also discusses the question: what’s social about social media?"
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_ellison_ris/,"Ellison’s research has been examining the ways in which new information and communication technologies shape social processes, and vice versa. Her recent research has focused on the social capital implications of social network site use and issues of self-presentation, relationship formation and maintenance, and impression formation in online contexts. Ellison’s talk will present research examining how people use the Internet to engage in self-presentation, form and maintain relationships, and garner social capital benefits. The talk will focus on two new streams of research: one examining the ways in which people use Facebook to connect with others and access social support and the other exploring online dating participants’ perceptions regarding acceptable and unacceptable misrepresentation in online dating profiles."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_suri_sim/,"The spread of influence among individuals in a social network can be naturally modeled in a probabilistic framework, but it is challenging to reason about differences between various models as well as to relate these models to actual social network data. Here we consider two of the most fundamental definitions of influence, one based on a small set of ""snapshot'' observations of a social network and the other based on detailed temporal dynamics. The former is particularly useful because large-scale social network data sets are often available only in snapshots or crawls. The latter however provides a more detailed process model of how influence spreads. We study the relationship between these two ways of measuring influence, in particular establishing how to infer the more detailed temporal measure from the more readily observable snapshot measure. We validate our analysis using the history of social interactions on Wikipedia; the result is the first large-scale study to exhibit a direct relationship between snapshot and temporal models of social influence."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_chang_esn/,"We propose an approach to determine the ethnic breakdown of a population based solely on people's names and data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. We demonstrate that our approach is able to predict the ethnicities of individuals as well as the ethnicity of an entire population better than natural alternatives. We apply our technique to the population of U.S. Facebook users and uncover the demographic characteristics of ethnicities and how they relate. We also discover that while Facebook has always been diverse, diversity has increased over time leading to a population that today looks very similar to the overall U.S. population. We also find that different ethnic groups relate to one another in an assortative manner, and that these groups have different profiles across demographics, beliefs, and usage of site features."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_tufekci_waf/,"There is an ongoing debate, not just among academics but in popular culture, about whether social media can expand people’s social networks, and whether online friends can be “real” friends. The debate refuses to die. This paper addresses this question subjectively, from the point of view of the user, and examines the predictors of acquiring new friends through social media use. This is a multi-method study with quantitative (n=617) and qualitative sections. Some previous studies have found a “rich-get-richer” effect where people who are socially active offline appear to benefit most from online interactions. This paper is based on the idea that whether online friends can be real friends may be subject to a self-fulfilling prophecy: those who do not believe that online friendships can be real friendships are not likely to make such connections. I compare the “Rich Get Richer” and “Seek and Ye Shall Find” models by examining relationships between the amount of offline socializing, amount of online social activity and the belief in online friendships. I also qualitatively examine reasons cited by respondents as to why online sociality is or is not a plausible route to meaningful friendship. The results show strong support for one of the earliest theories of computer-mediated-communication: hyperpersonal interaction. It appears that a sizable portion of the young generation finds online interaction positive because it is perceived to concentrate on the conversation itself, rather than on appearances, and is seen as freer of social judgments. African-Americans are significantly more likely to meet new friends online. There also appear to be underlying personality traits, apart from traditional demographic variables, that divide the population in terms of their attitude towards online sociality."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_couronne_tbs/,"The emergence of online platforms allowing to mix self publishing activities and social networking offers new possibilities for building online reputation and visibility. In this paper we present a method to analyze the online popularity that takes into consideration both the success of the published content and the social network topology. First, we adapt the Kohonen self organizing maps in order to cluster the users of online platforms depending on their audience and authority characteristics. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of the manner nodes are organized in the social network. Finally, we study the relationship between the network local structure around each node and the corresponding user’s popularity. We apply this method to the MySpace music social network. We observe that the most popular artists are centers of star shaped social structures and that it exists a fraction of artists who are involved in community and social activity dynamics independently of their popularity. This method based on a learning algorithm and on network analysis appears to be a robust and intuitive technique for a rich description of the online behavior."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_simmons_sde/,"This paper examines social structures underlying economic activity in Second Life (SL), a massively multiplayer virtual world that allows users to create and trade virtual objects and commodities. We find that users conduct many of their transactions both within their social networks and within groups. Using frequency of chat as a proxy of tie strength, we observe that free items are more likely to be exchanged as the strength of the tie increases. Social ties particularly play a significant role in paid transactions for sellers with a moderately sized customer base. We further find that sellers enjoying repeat business are likely to be selling to niche markets, because their customers tend to be contained in a smaller number of groups. But while social structure and interaction can help explain a seller's revenues and repeat business, they provide little information in the forecasting a seller's future performance. Our quantitative analysis is complemented by a novel method of visualizing the transaction activity of a seller, including revenue, customer base growth, and repeat business."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_counts_ybf/,"We measured individuals’ mental associations between four types of media (books, television, social/Facebook, and general informational web pages) and relevant concepts (Addictive, Story, Interesting, Frivolous, Personal, and Useful) using three different measurements: a Likert scale questionnaire, a speeded Yes/No judgment task, and electrical brain activity. The three measures were designed to capture associations at different levels of mental processing, from very automatic (electrical brain activity) to conscious and reasoned (questionnaire). At more conscious levels of cognitive processing, Facebook was seen as interesting, addictive, and highly personal. Results for the electrical brain activity measure show that Facebook tells less of a story and, surprisingly, is less personal than other forms of media. We discuss differences in results across the three measures and how our findings can inform the design of future social media systems."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_girju_tsc/,"In this paper we present encouraging preliminary results into the problem of social causality (causal reasoning used by intelligent agents in a social environment) in online social interactions based on a model of reciprocity. At every level, social relationships are guided by the shared understanding that most actions call for appropriate reactions, and that inappropriate reactions require management. Thus, we present an analysis of interpersonal relationships in English reciprocal contexts. Specifically, we rely here on a large and recently built database of 10,882 reciprocal relation instances in online media. The resource is analyzed along a set of novel and important dimensions: symmetry, affective value, gender}, and {\em intentionality of action which are highly interconnected. At a larger level, we automatically generate {\em chains of causal relations} between verbs indicating interpersonal relationships. Statistics along these dimensions give insights into people's behavior, judgments, and thus their social interactions."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_dechoudhury_hdd/,"Platforms such as Twitter have provided researchers with ample opportunities to analytically study social phenomena. There are however, significant computational challenges due to the enormous rate of production of new information: researchers are therefore, often forced to analyze a judiciously selected “sample” of the data. Like other social media phenomena, information diffusion is a social process–it is affected by user context, and topic, in addition to the graph topology. This paper studies the impact of different attribute and topology based sampling strategies on the discovery of an important social media phenomena–information diffusion. We examine several widely-adopted sampling methods that select nodes based on attribute (random, location, and activity) and topology (forest fire) as well as study the impact of attribute based seed selection on topology based sampling. Then we develop a series of metrics for evaluating the quality of the sample, based on user activity (e.g. volume, number of seeds), topological (e.g. reach, spread) and temporal characteristics (e.g. rate). We additionally correlate the diffusion volume metric with two external variables–search and news trends. Our experiments reveal that for small sample sizes (30%), a sample that incorporates both topology and user context (e.g. location, activity) can improve on naive methods by a significant margin of 15-20%."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_russo_tot/,"Along with the growth in artifact sharing in online communities such as Flickr, YouTube, and Facebook comes the demand for adding descriptive meta-information, or tags. Tags help individuals to organize and communicate the content and context of their work for themselves and for others. This longitudinal study draws on research in social psychology, network theory and online communities to explain tagging over time. Our findings suggest that tagging increases as a contributor receives attention from others in the community. Further, we find that the more a user's network neighbors are connected to each other directly, the less the focal user will tend to tag his photos. However, density interacts with attention such that those who are surrounded by a dense ego network respond more to attention than others whose ego networks are sparsely interconnected. Unexpectedly, we find no direct correlation between tagging and the individual motivations of enjoyment and commitment. While commitment is not directly associated with tagging, there is an interaction effect such that the effect of commitment on tagging is positive for users with low-density ego networks and negative when a user is surrounded by a high-density network. Directions for future research as well as implications for theory and practice are discussed."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_shami_ehrlich_mio/,"Microblogging has recently generated a lot of research interest. Yet very little is known about how corporate employees use microblogging tools. This study examined microblogging in the workplace by conducting a content analysis comparing posts from individuals who were using an internal proprietary tool and Twitter simultaneously. In both settings, posts that provided information or were directed to others were more common than posts on status. Within these categories, it was more frequent to provide information externally than internally but more common to ask questions either through broadcast or directed posts internally than externally. Qualitative interviews explored users’ motivations regarding microblogging behavior. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of microblogging for business use."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_cha_mui/,"Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip. Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others — a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_romero_dcp/,"It has often been taken as a working assumption that directed links in information networks are frequently formed by ""short-cutting'' a two-step path between the source and the destination — a kind of implicit ""link copying'' analogous to the process of triadic closure in social networks. Despite the role of this assumption in theoretical models such as preferential attachment, it has received very little direct empirical investigation. Here we develop a formalization and methodology for studying this type of directed closure process, and we provide evidence for its important role in the formation of links on Twitter. We then analyze a sequence of models designed to capture the structural phenomena related to directed closure that we observe in the Twitter data."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_ramage_cmt/,"As microblogging grows in popularity, services like Twitter are coming to support information gathering needs above and beyond their traditional roles as social networks. But most users’ interaction with Twitter is still primarily focused on their social graphs, forcing the often inappropriate conflation of “people I follow” with “stuff I want to read.” We characterize some information needs that the current Twitter interface fails to support, and argue for better representations of content for solving these challenges. We present a scalable implementation of a partially supervised learning model (Labeled LDA) that maps the content of the Twitter feed into dimensions. These dimensions correspond roughly to substance, style, status, and social characteristics of posts. We characterize users and tweets using this model, and present results on two information consumption oriented tasks."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_sprenger_pet/,"Twitter is a microblogging website where users read and write millions of short messages on a variety of topics every day. This study uses the context of the German federal election to investigate whether Twitter is used as a forum for political deliberation and whether online messages on Twitter validly mirror offline political sentiment. Using LIWC text analysis software, we conducted a content-analysis of over 100,000 messages containing a reference to either a political party or a politician. Our results show that Twitter is indeed used extensively for political deliberation. We find that the mere number of messages mentioning a party reflects the election result. Moreover, joint mentions of two parties are in line with real world political ties and coalitions. An analysis of the tweets’ political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to the parties' and politicians’ political positions indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape. We discuss the use of microblogging message content as a valid indicator of political sentiment and derive suggestions for further research."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_oconnor_ftp/,"We connect measures of public opinion measured from polls with sentiment measured from text. We analyze several surveys on consumer conﬁdence and political opinion over the 2008 to 2009 period, and ﬁnd they correlate to sentiment word frequencies in contemporaneous Twitter messages. While our results vary across datasets, in several cases the correlations are as high as 80%, and capture important large-scale trends. The results highlight the potential of text streams as a substitute and supplement for traditional polling. consumer conﬁdence and political opinion, and can also pre- dict future movements in the polls. We ﬁnd that temporal smoothing is a critically important issue to support a successful model."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_lerman_ice/,"Social networks have emerged as a critical factor in information dissemination, search, marketing, expertise and influence discovery, and potentially an important tool for mobilizing people. Social media has made social networks ubiquitous, and also given researchers access to massive quantities of data for empirical analysis. These data sets offer a rich source of evidence for studying dynamics of individual and group behavior, the structure of networks and global patterns of the flow of information on them. However, in most previous studies, the structure of the underlying networks was not directly visible but had to be inferred from the flow of information from one individual to another. As a result, we do not yet understand dynamics of information spread on networks or how the structure of the network affects it. We address this gap by analyzing data from two popular social news sites. Specifically, we extract social networks of active users on Digg and Twitter, and track how interest in news stories spreads among them. We show that social networks play a crucial role in the spread of information on these sites, and that network structure affects dynamics of information flow."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_yardi_tts/,"This paper examines tweets about two geographically local events - a shooting and a building collapse - that took place in Wichita, Kansas and Atlanta, Georgia, respectively. Most Internet research has focused on examining ways the Internet can connect people across long distances, yet there are benefits to being connected to others who are nearby. People in close geographic proximity can provide real-time information and eyewitness updates for one another about events of local interest. We first show a relationship between structural properties in the Twitter network and geographic properties in the physical world. We then describe the role of mainstream news in disseminating local information. Last, we present a poll of 164 users’ information seeking practices. We conclude with practical and theoretical implications for sharing information in local communities."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_mankoff_ies/,"Decades of research have explored factors that can influence green behavior. However, much less is known about how technology in general, and social technologies in particular can motivate people to participate in green activities. In this paper we describe the goals, design and evaluation of StepGreen.org, a site intended to promote energy-saving behaviors. We present the results of a field study, during which participants chose to engage in different actions and reported when they had completed them. Our results suggest that motivating factors like public commitment and competition are effective, and better leveraging these factors will likely lead to even greater appeal and effectiveness. Our contribution is to create an understanding of the impact of different decisions on the success of StepGreen.org that can benefit the designers of other multifaceted, online systems for behavior change."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_leskovec_gsm/,"Social media sites are often guided by a core group of committed users engaged in various forms of {governance. A crucial aspect of this type of governance is deliberation, in which such a group reaches decisions on issues of importance to the site. Despite its crucial — though subtle — role in how a number of prominent social media sites function, there has been relatively little investigation of the deliberative aspects of social media governance. Here we explore this issue, investigating a particular deliberative process that is extensive, public, and recorded: the promotion of Wikipedia admins, which is determined by elections that engage committed members of the Wikipedia community. We find that the group decision-making at the heart of this process exhibits several fundamental forms of relative assessment. First we observe that the chance that a voter will support a candidate is strongly dependent on the relationship between characteristics of the voter and the candidate. Second we investigate how both individual voter decisions and overall election outcomes can be based on models that take into account the sequential, public nature of the voting."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_monroy_hernandez_mako_hill_rrs/,"In this paper we describe the ways participants of the Scratch online community, primarily young people, engage in remixing of each others' shared animations, games, and interactive projects. In particular, we try to answer the following questions: How do users respond to remixing in a social media environment where remixing is explicitly permitted? What qualities of originators and their projects correspond to a higher likelihood of plagiarism accusations? Is there a connection between plagiarism complaints and similarities between a remix and the work it is based on? Our findings indicate that users have a very wide range of reactions to remixing and that as many users react positively as accuse remixers of plagiarism. We test several hypotheses that might explain the high number of plagiarism accusations related to original project complexity, cumulative remixing, originators' integration into remixing practice, and remixee-remixer project similarity, and find support for the first and last explanations."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_tsur_gcn/,"Sarcasm is a sophisticated form of speech act widely used in online communities. Automatic recognition of sarcasm is, however, a novel task. Sarcasm recognition could contribute to the performance of review summarization and ranking systems. This paper presents SASI, a novel Semi-supervised Algorithm for Sarcasm Identification that recognizes sarcastic sentences in product reviews. SASI has two stages: semi-supervised pattern acquisition, and sarcasm classification. We experimented on a data set of about 66000 Amazon reviews for various books and products. Using a gold standard in which each sentence was tagged by 3 annotators, we obtained precision of 77% and recall of 83.1% for identifying sarcastic sentences. We found some strong features that characterize sarcastic utterances. However, a combination of more subtle pattern-based features proved more promising in identifying the various facets of sarcasm. We also speculate on the motivation for using sarcasm in online communities and social networks."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_mcglohon_arr/,"Given a set of reviews of products or merchants from a wide range of authors and several reviews websites, how can we measure the true quality of the product or merchant?  How do we remove the bias of individual authors or sources?  How do we compare reviews obtained from different websites, where ratings may be on different scales (1-5 stars, A/B/C, etc.)?  How do we filter out unreliable reviews to use only the ones with ""star quality""?  Taking into account these considerations, we analyze data sets from a variety of different reviews sites (the first paper, to our knowledge, to do this). These data sets include 8 million product reviews and 1.5 million merchant reviews. We explore statistic - and heuristic - based models for estimating the true quality of a product or merchant, and compare the performance of these estimators on the task of ranking pairs of objects.  We also apply the same models to the task of using Netflix ratings data to rank pairs of movies, and discover that the performance of the different models is surprisingly similar on this data set."
