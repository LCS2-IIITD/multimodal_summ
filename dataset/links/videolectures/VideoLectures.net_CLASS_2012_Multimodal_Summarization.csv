http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_keahey_computing/,"Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud computing has profoundly changed the way we procure, manage, and use compute and storage resources. Since it allows users to easily provision remote resources on-demand, it enabled whole communities to treat the acquisition of compute and storage resources as an operational consideration rather than capital acquisition. The emergence of this new model raises many questions. How will infrastructure clouds change our work patterns? Is it a viable solution for scientific applications? What challenges need to be overcome to enable and facilitate a transition to this new computing model? The Nimbus project has been promoting the use of infrastructure clouds in the scientific community for nearly a decade. In this talk, I will describe what attracted various communities to infrastructure cloud computing, give examples of how they integrated this new model into their work, and describe the challenges they encountered while doing so. I will briefly discuss how those challenges shaped the development of a variety of features in Nimbus Infrastructure as well as infrastructure cloud platform which provides an integrated set of tools enabling deployment, auto-scaling and high availability across multiple academic and commercial clouds. I will discuss scientific applications currently making use of such multi-cloud environment as well as factors shaping the future of this rapidly developing field."
http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_little_vision/,"Platform as a Service has gained great popularity over the past two years. Many vendors have rewritten their middleware handbooks, and discarded existing investments in Java EE. With the rapid growth in interest around mobile, we're starting to hear the same things: that existing middleware implementations and approaches are simply not right for the mobile developer. In short, Cloud and Mobile represent the death of middleware! However, we believe that this approach may be short-sighted and risky. Not only does enterprise Java (particularly Java EE) have a critical role to play in Java-based PaaS and mobile solutions, but it can also be used as a platform for other languages such as Ruby, that are finding growing adoption in both of these areas. The requirements for real world Cloud or Mobile applications include reliability, security, fault tolerance and much more: things that your typical enterprise middleware developer has taken for granted for four decades. In this session we will discuss the needs for enterprise Java in both Cloud and Mobile. We will also suggest how Java, the JVM and associated standards and communities need to evolve in order to better serve these two growing and important aspects computing."

The Silicon Valley is a unique ecosystem in the world with large companies like Google, Apple and a myriad of start-ups shaping the future of cloud computing together with leading research labs such as the AmpLab laboratory at UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). While AmpLab research activities are at the intersection of machine learning, cloud computing, and crowd sourcing, researchers at LBNL investigate cloud computing and data analytics for Science. In my talk, I will present some of the on-going research and development projects on cloud computing carried out in the San Francisco Bay area."
http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_podgorsek_applications/,"We will introduce IBM Image Construction and Composition Tool that allows you to create custom operating system content, custom middleware, IBM & non-IBM software into custom cloud content and deploy to supported Cloud Provider. ICCT provides a systematic approach to construct virtual images in the cloud. During activation of the virtual image, you can provide customisation parameters for your environment. This allows a single virtual image to take on many different forms during the activation process in the cloud, thus allowing a single image to meet a wide variety of usage scenarios and is improving your application lifecycle maintenance."
http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_talia_data/,This talk discusses two important research topics in Cloud Computing: service-oriented knowledge discovery and agent computing in Cloud systems. Cloud-based knowledge discovery issues and systems are presented and the integrated use of multi-agent systems and Clouds are discussed.
http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_di_martino_project/,"Cloud vendor lock-in and interoperability gaps arise (among many reasons) when semantics of resources and services, and of Application Programming Interfaces is not shared. Standards and techniques borrowed from SOA and Semantic Web Services areas might help in gaining shared, machine readable description of Cloud offerings (resources, Services at Platform and Application level, and their API groundings), thus allowing automatic discovery, matchmaking, and thus supporting selection, brokering, interoperability end even composition of Cloud Services among multiple Clouds. The EU funded mOSAIC project (http://www.mosaic-cloud.eu) aims at designing and developing an innovative open-source API and platform that enables applications to be Cloud providers' neutral and to negotiate Cloud services as requested by their users. Using the mOSAIC Cloud ontology and Semantic Engine, cloud applications' developers will be able to specify their services and resources requirements and communicate them to the mOSAIC Platform and Cloud Agency. The mOSAIC Cloud Agency will implement a multi-agent brokering mechanism that will search for Cloud services matching the applications’ request, and possibly compose the requested service."
http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_ducatel_leadership/,"The European Commission is making a strategic plan to promote the take-up of cloud in the EU. The actions in the plan provide a basis for tackling some of the key issues that stakeholders have identified as major barriers such as trust and security, and for contract terms that give users the confidence to adopt services that are open and portable. The Commission has also announced a European Cloud Partnership to put Europe's public authorities at the forefront of cloud adoption by developing common requirements and more common approaches in general. The presentation will explain the steps that the Commission is taking to implement these actions, the analysis behind and how the cloud communities on the ground in Member States can get involved."

http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_reichstaedter_cloud/,"The IT industry is pushing cloud computing with the use of new paradigms. The keyword cloud means highly complex and standardized provisioning. Cloud especially change the legal environment - direct control is replaced with contractual agreements (who is responsible for for the management of data protection and the owner of the the data). We have to develop policies/guidelines especially for small public administration units (e.g. municipalities) before we start. More and more less transparency where are my data, how they are protected - maybe no national or european control. Even in the cloud we need security standards like eIDs."

http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_schubert_infrastructures/,"Future usage requirements are designated by a vast heterogeneity on all levels: not only types of resources, but also interconnects, use cases and users. And yet, it will be expected that they all will be supported equally well with little additional effort on behalf of the user and, ideally, the developer. Classical execution and programming mechanisms, i.e. operating systems, virtualisation technologies etc. are insufficient for this vision. Instead, a complete rethinking of how we understand programs and execution is necessary."

The main reason for integration problems is the insufficient mechanisms for integration of SaaS applications that are conceptually different from local applications. As the use of SaaS applications grows the need for efficient and robust integration approach is becoming obvious. In our presentation, we will present the requirements for the realization of SaaS integration and how the IPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) addresses integration challenges in the cloud. We will also present today’s innovative IPaaS solutions and how could next-generation SaaS integration look like in the future."
http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_tomasic_hadoop/,MapReduce is a programming model implemented with a library for processing large datasets - often termed as BigData - on clusters of commodity computers. MapReduce is typically used for distributed processing of non-structured datasets. The map function processes key/value pairs and generates intermediate key/value pairs based on user specified map function. The reduce function merges and processes intermediate values belonging to the same key. A simple example of MapReduce will be shown on the open source software framework Apache Hadoop.
http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_dukaric_platform/,"The recent development in cloud computing also resulted in a demand for designing and executing Java EE applications in the cloud environment. The existing design of Java EE does not allow the developers and infrastructure providers to take full advantage of cloud computing for running such applications — containers do not scale automatically, multitenancy is not supported and finally, there are no monitoring capabilities. In this paper we review the characteristics of Java EE execution in the cloud environment and propose a parameter system to support and effect the deployment and application execution. Based on the proposed parameter system we derive metadata which can be used by developers to take the advantage of cloud specific behaviour. We show how metadata was implemented and how the application scalability capabilities were improved."
http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_dukaric_solutions/,"Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is one of the most important layers of Cloud Computing. However, there is an evident deficiency of mechanisms for analysis, comparison and evaluation of IaaS cloud implementations, since no unified reference architecture is available. In this article, we propose a reference IaaS architectural framework. The reference framework is structured around seven layers: core service layer, support layer, value-added services, control layer, management layer, security layer and resource abstraction. We provide detailed description of each layer and define dependencies between the layers and components. Finally, we validate the proposed reference IaaS architectural framework on several real-world projects, while performing a comprehensive analysis of the most important commercial and open-source IaaS products. The evaluation results show notable distinction of feature support and capabilities between commercial and open-source IaaS platforms, significant deficiency of important architectural components in terms of fulfilling true promise of infrastructure clouds, and real-world usability of the proposed architectural framework."

http://videolectures.net/classconference2012_vicic_bostic_hybrid/,"In this paper we present a research and a pilot implementation of a monitoring architecture for hybrid computer cloud. The hybrid cloud consists of three different cloud infrastructures: VMware, HyperV and OpenStack. The ongoing research focuses on the selection of a standardized set of monitoring features and an efficient architecture to support the monitoring itself. The paper discusses two approaches to interconnect monitoring in hybrid clouds including all necessary interfaces. In the pilot implementation we used a less standardized approach due to time bounds on the project. Furthermore, we implemented two monitoring systems, where the first one was just a poof of concept, while in the other one we implemented a complete monitoring infrastructure for a hybrid cloud. Moreover, on top of the infrastructure we built a fully operational support for SLAs."
