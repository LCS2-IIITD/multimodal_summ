http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_malone_collective_intelligence/,"The original vision of the Semantic Web was to encode semantic content on the web in a form with which machines can reason.  But in the last few years, we've seen many new Internet-based applications (such as Wikipedia, Linux, and prediction markets) where the key reasoning is done, not by machines, but by large groups of people.   This talk will show how a relatively small set of design patterns can help understand a wide variety of these examples.  Each design pattern is useful in different conditions, and the patterns can be combined in different ways to create different kinds of collective intelligence.  Building on this foundation, the talk will consider how the Semantic Web might contribute to-and benefit from-these more human-intensive forms of collective intelligence."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_holm_interoperability/,"Data.gov, a flagship open government project from the US government, opens and shares data to improve government efficiency and drive innovation.  Sharing such data allows us to make rich comparisons that could never be made before and helps us to better understand the data and support decision making.  The adoption of open linked data, vocabularies and ontologies, the work of the W3C, and semantic technologies is helping to drive Data.gov and US data forward.  This session will help us to better understand the changing global landscape of data sharing and the role the semantic web is playing in it.  This session highlights specific data sharing examples of solving mission problems from NASA, the White House, and many other governments agencies and citizen innovators."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_musen_climate_change/,"In the 1990s, as the World Wide Web became not only world wide but also dense and ubiquitous, workers in the artificial intelligence community were drawn to the possibility that the Web could provide the foundation for a new kind of AI.  Having survived the AI Winter of the 1980s, the opportunities that they saw in the largest, most interconnected computing platform imaginable were obviously compelling.  With the subsequent success of the Semantic Web, however, our community seems to have stopped talking about many of the issues that researchers believe led to the AI Winter in the first place: the cognitive challenges in debugging and maintaining complex systems, the drift in the meanings ascribed to symbols, the situated nature of knowledge, the fundamental difficulty of creating robust models.  These challenges are still with us; we cannot wish them away with appeals to the open-world assumption or to the law of large numbers.  Embracing these challenges will allow us to expand the scope of our science and our practice, and will help to bring us closer to the ultimate vision of the Semantic Web."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_big_graph_data/,"he Semantic Web / Linked Data has grown immensely over the past years. When the Semantic Web community started working over a decade ago the main question was where to get the data from. By now the question of how to process ever increasing amount of semantic/linked data has come to people's utmost attention. The goal of this panel is to shed light on the various approaches/options for Big Graph Data processing. Possible questions include: Does the Semantic Web need any central infrastructures? (It's a Web, after all?) Or will a handful of large single-owner infrastructures dominate the Semantic Web, just as they now dominate the current Web?  And if so, will such infrastructures be based on the standard relational model? Or on MapReduce-centric key/value-pairs? Is Google's (centralised) Knowledge Graph anathema to the Semantic *Web* ? Are triplestore vendors just reinventing the old database wheels? What is the role of clustered MapReduce-like solutions and where are their limits for processing semantic web data?"
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_rula_linked_data/,"An increasing amount of data is published and consumed on the Web according to the Linked Data paradigm. In consideration of both publishers and consumers, the temporal dimension of data is important. In this paper we investigate the characterisation and availability of temporal information in Linked Data at large scale. Based on an abstract denition of temporal information we conduct experiments to evaluate the availability of such information using the data from the 2011 Billion Triple Challenge (BTC) dataset. Focusing in particular on the representation of temporal meta-information, i.e., temporal information associated with RDF statements and graphs, we investigate the approaches proposed in the literature, performing both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis and proposing guidelines for data consumers and publishers. Our experiments show that the amount of temporal information available in the LOD cloud is still very small; several dierent models have been used on dierent datasets, with a prevalence of approaches based on the annotation of RDF documents."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_taheriyan_data_cloud/,"The amount of data available in the Linked Data cloud continues to grow. Yet, few services consume and produce linked data. There is recent work that allows a user to dene a linked service from an online service, which includes the specications for consuming and producing linked data, but building such models is time consuming and requires specialized knowledge of RDF and SPARQL. This paper presents a new approach that allows domain experts to rapidly create semantic models of services by demonstration in an interactive web-based interface. First, the user provides examples of the service request URLs. Then, the system automatically proposes a service model the user can rene interactively. Finally, the system saves a service specication using a new expressive vocabulary that includes lowering and lifting rules. This approach empowers end users to rapidly model existing services and immediately use them to consume and produce linked data."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_ngonga_ngomo_minkowski_measures/,"Time-efficient algorithms are essential to address the complex linking tasks that arise when trying to discover links on the Web of Data. Although several lossless approaches have been developed for this exact purpose, they do not oer theoretical guarantees with respect to their performance. In this paper, we address this drawback by presenting the first Link Discovery approach with theoretical quality guarantees. In particular, we prove that given an achievable reduction ratio r, our Link Discovery approach HR3 can achieve a reduction ratio r' ≤ r in a metric space where distances are measured by the means of a Minkowski metric of any order p ≥ 2. We compare HR3 and the HYPPO algorithm implemented in LIMES 0.5 with respect to the number of comparisons they carry out. In addition, we compare our approach with the algorithms implemented in the state-of-the-art frameworks LIMES 0.5 and SILK 2.5 with respect to runtime. We show that HR3 outperforms these previous approaches with respect to runtime in each of our four experimental setups."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_klarman_provenance_records/,"Data provenance is the history of derivation of a data artifact from its original sources. As the real-life provenance records can likely cover thousands of data items and derivation steps, one of the pressing challenges becomes development of formal frameworks for their automated verification. In this paper, we consider data expressed in standard Semantic Web ontology languages, such as OWL, and define a novel verification formalism called provenance specification logic, building on dynamic logic. We validate our proposal by modeling the test queries presented in The First Provenance Challenge, and conclude that the logic core of such queries can be successfully captured in our formalism."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_viegas_damasio_sparql_queries/,"Determining trust of data available in the Semantic Web is fundamental for applications and users, in particular for linked open data obtained from SPARQL endpoints. There exist several proposals in the literature to annotate SPARQL query results with values from abstract models, adapting the seminal works on provenance for annotated relational databases.We provide an approach capable of providing provenance information for a large and significant fragment of SPARQL 1.1, including for the first time the major non-monotonic constructs under multiset semantics. The approach is based on the translation of SPARQL into relational queries over annotated relations with values of the most general m-semiring, and in this way also refuting a claim in the literature that the OPTIONAL construct of SPARQL cannot be captured appropriately with the known abstract models."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_gerber_defacto/,"One of the main tasks when creating and maintaining knowledge bases is to validate facts and provide sources for them in order to ensure correctness and traceability of the provided knowledge. So far, this task is often addressed by human curators in a three-step process: issuing appropriate keyword queries for the statement to check using standard search engines, retrieving potentially relevant documents and screening those documents for relevant content. The drawbacks of this process are manifold. Most importantly, it is very time-consuming as the experts have to carry out several search processes and must often read several documents. In this article, we present DeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) – an algorithm for validating facts by finding trustworthy sources for it on the Web. DeFacto aims to provide an effective way of validating facts by supplying the user with relevant excerpts of webpages as well as useful additional information including a score for the confidence DeFacto has in the correctness of the input fact."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_kyzirakos_strabon/,"We present Strabon, a new RDF store that supports the state of the art semantic geospatial query languages stSPARQL and GeoSPARQL. To illustrate the expressive power oered by these query  languages and their implementation in Strabon, we concentrate on the new version of the data model stRDF and the query language stSPARQL that we have developed ourselves. Like GeoSPARQL, these new versions use OGC standards to represent geometries where the original versions used linear constraints.We study the performance of Strabon experimentally and show that it scales to very large data volumes and performs, most of the times, better than all other geospatial RDF stores it has been compared with."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_henson_constrained_devices/,"The primary challenge of machine perception is to define efficient computational methods to derive high-level knowledge from low-level sensor observation data. Emerging solutions are using ontologies for expressive representation of concepts in the domain of sensing and perception, which enable advanced integration and interpretation of heterogeneous sensor data. The computational complexity of OWL, however, seriously limits its applicability and use within resource-constrained environments, such as mobile devices. To overcome this issue, we employ OWL to formally define the inference tasks needed for machine perception – explanation and discrimination – and then provide efficient algorithms for these tasks, using bit-vector encodings and operations. The applicability of our approach to machine perception is evaluated on a smart-phone mobile device, demonstrating dramatic improvements in both efficiency and scale."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_calbimonte_srbench/,"We introduce SRBench, a general-purpose benchmark primarily designed for streaming RDF/SPARQL engines, completely based on real-world data sets from the Linked Open Data cloud. With the increasing problem of too much streaming data but not enough tools to gain knowledge from them, researchers have set out for solutions in which Semantic Web technologies are adapted and extended for publishing, sharing, analysing and understanding streaming data. To help researchers and users comparing streaming RDF/SPARQL (strRS) engines in a standardised application scenario, we have designed SRBench, with which one can assess the abilities of a strRS engine to cope with a broad range of use cases typically encountered in real-world scenarios. The data sets used in the benchmark have been carefully chosen, such that they represent a realistic and relevant usage of streaming data. The benchmark defines a concise, yet comprehensive set of queries that cover the major aspects of strRS processing. Finally, our work is complemented with a functional evaluation on three representative strRS engines: SPARQLStream, C-SPARQL and CQELS. The presented results are meant to give a first baseline and illustrate the state-of-the-art."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_kotoulas_analytical_sparql/,"We describe a system that incrementally translates SPARQL queries to Pig Latin and executes them on a Hadoop cluster. This system is designed to work efficiently on complex queries with many self-joins over huge datasets, avoiding job failures even in the case of joins with unexpected high-value skew. To be robust against cost estimation errors, our system interleaves query optimization with query execution, determining the next steps to take based on data samples and statistics gathered during the previous step. Furthermore, we have developed a novel skew-resistant join algorithm that replicates tuples corresponding to popular keys. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach both on a synthetic benchmark known to generate complex queries (BSBM-BI) as well as on a Yahoo! case of data analysis using RDF data crawled from the web. Our results indicate that our system is indeed capable of processing huge datasets without pre-computed statistics while exhibiting good load-balancing properties."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_goerlitz_splodge/,"The distributed and heterogeneous nature of Linked Open Data requires flexible and federated techniques for query evaluation. In order to evaluate current federation querying approaches a general methodology for conducting benchmarks is mandatory. In this paper, we present a classication methodology for federated SPARQL queries. This methodology can be used by developers of federated querying approaches to compose a set of test benchmarks that cover diverse characteristics of different queries and allows for comparability. We further develop a heuristic called SPLODGE for automatic generation of benchmark queries that is based on this methodology and takes into account the number of sources to be queried and several complexity parameters. We evaluate the adequacy of our methodology and the query generation strategy by applying them on the 2011 billion triple challenge data set."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_heino_parallel_hardware/,"Recent developments in hardware have shown an increase in parallelism as opposed to clock rates. In order to fully exploit these new avenues of performance improvement, computationally expensive workloads have to be expressed in a way that allows for fine-grained parallelism. In this paper, we address the problem of describing RDFS entailment in such a way. Dierent from previous work on parallel RDFS reasoning, we assume a shared memory architecture. We analyze the problem of duplicates that naturally occur in RDFS reasoning and develop strategies towards its mitigation, exploiting all levels of our architecture. We implement and evaluate our approach on two real-world datasets and study its performance characteristics on dierent levels of parallelization. We conclude that RDFS entailment lends itself well to parallelization but can benefit even more from careful optimizations that take into account intricacies of modern parallel hardware."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_saif_sentiment_analysis/,"Sentiment analysis over Twitter offer organisations a fast and effective way to monitor the publics’ feelings towards their brand, business, directors, etc. A wide range of features and methods for training sentiment classifiers for Twitter datasets have been researched in recent years with varying results. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of adding semantics as additional features into the training set for sentiment analysis. For each extracted entity (e.g. iPhone) from tweets, we add its semantic concept (e.g. “Apple product”) as an additional feature, and measure the correlation of the representative concept with negative/positive sentiment.We apply this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets. Our results show an average increase of F harmonic accuracy score for identifying both negative and positive sentiment of around 6.5% and 4.8% over the baselines of unigrams and part-of-speech features respectively. We also compare against an approach based on sentiment-bearing topic analysis, and find that semantic features produce better Recall and F score when classifying negative sentiment, and better Precision with lower Recall and F score in positive sentiment classification."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_sarasua_crowdmap/,"The last decade of research in ontology alignment has brought a variety of computational techniques to discover correspondences between ontologies. While the accuracy of automatic approaches has continuously improved, human contributions remain a key ingredient of the process: this input serves as a valuable source of domain knowledge that is used to train the algorithms and to validate and augment automatically computed alignments. In this paper, we introduce CROWDMAP, a model to acquire such human contributions via microtask crowdsourcing. For a given pair of ontologies, CROWDMAP translates the alignment problem into microtasks that address individual alignment questions, publishes the microtasks on an online labor market, and evaluates the quality of the results obtained from the crowd. We evaluated the current implementation of CROWDMAP in a series of experiments using ontologies and reference alignments from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative and the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. The experiments clearly demonstrated that the overall approach is feasible, and can improve the accuracy of existing ontology alignment solutions in a fast, scalable, and cost-effective manner."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_kotoulas_queriocity/,"In this paper, we present QuerioCity, a platform to catalog, index and query highly heterogenous information coming from complex systems, such as cities. A series of challenges are identified: namely, the heterogeneity of the domain and the lack of a common model, the volume of information and the number of data sets, the requirement for a low entry threshold to the system, the diversity of the input data, in terms of format, syntax and update frequency (streams vs static data), and the sensitivity of the information. We propose an approach for incremental and continuous integration of static and streaming data, based on Semantic Web technologies. The proposed system is unique in the literature in terms of handling of multiple integrations of available data sets in combination with flexible provenance tracking, privacy protection and continuous integration of streams. We report on lessons learnt from building the first prototype for Dublin."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_shvaiko_trentino_government/,"Our work is settled in the context of the public administration domain, where data can come from different entities, can be produced, stored and delivered in different formats and can have different levels of quality. Hence, such a heterogeneity has to be addressed, while performing various data integration tasks. We report our experimental work on publishing some government linked open geo-metadata and geo-data of the Italian Trentino region. Specifically, we illustrate how 161 core geographic datasets were released by leveraging on the geo-catalogue application within the existing geo-portal. We discuss the lessons we learned from deploying and using the application as well as from the released datasets."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_celino_urbanmatch/,"To realize the Smart Cities vision, applications can leverage the large availability of open datasets related to urban environments. Those datasets need to be integrated, but it is often hard to automatically achieve a high-quality interlinkage. Human Computation approaches can be employed to solve such a task where machines are inefective. We argue that in this case not only people's background knowledge is useful to solve the task, but also people's physical presence and direct experience can be successfully exploited. In this paper we present UrbanMatch, a Game with a Purpose for players in mobility aimed at validating links between points of interest and their photos; we discuss the design choices and we show the high throughput and accuracy achieved in the interlinking task."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_le_phuoc_processing_engines/,"Linked Stream Data, i.e., the RDF data model extended for representing stream data generated from sensors social network applications, is gaining popularity. This has motivated considerable work on developing corresponding data models associated with processing engines. However, current implemented engines have not been thoroughly evaluated to assess their capabilities. For reasonable systematic evaluations, in this work we propose a novel, customizable evaluation framework and a corresponding methodology for realistic data generation, system testing, and result analysis. Based on this evaluation environment, extensive experiments have been conducted in order to compare the state-of-the-art LSD engines wrt. qualitative and quantitative properties, taking into account the underlying principles of stream processing. Consequently, we provide a detailed analysis of the experimental outcomes that reveal useful findings for improving current and future engines."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2012_vidal_query_engines/,"Testbeds proposed so far to evaluate, compare, and eventually improve SPARQL query federation systems have still some limitations. Some variables and congurations that may have an impact on the behavior of these systems (e.g., network latency, data partitioning and query properties) are not suciently dened; this aects the results and repeatability of independent evaluation studies, and hence the insights that can be obtained from them. In this paper we evaluate FedBench, the most comprehensive testbed up to now, and empirically probe the need of considering additional dimensions and variables. The evaluation has been conducted on three SPARQL query federation systems, and the analysis of these results has allowed to uncover properties of these systems that would normally be hidden with the original testbeds."
