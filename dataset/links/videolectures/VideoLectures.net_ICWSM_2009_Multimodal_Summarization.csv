http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_kleinberg_mtdfoi/,"News, discussion, and opinions travel through an overlapping set of on-line networks, involving e-mail, blogging, and other forms of communication. We discuss a set of approaches for tracking pieces of text as they travel and mutate in these networks, applying these ideas to a set of related problems. First, we show how this type of analysis can capture temporal patterns in the news over a daily time-scale --- in particular, the succession of story lines that evolve, compete for attention, and collectively produces an effect that commentators refer to as the 'news cycle.' Second, we show how this approach can be combined with an analysis of network structure to trace the diffusion of specific pieces of information as they spread between people at a global scale. This talk includes joint work with Lars Backstrom, Jure Leskovec, and David Liben-Nowell."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_lee_fisaom/,"""What do other people think?"" has always been an important consideration to most of us when making decisions. Long before the World Wide Web, we asked our friends who they were planning to vote for and consulted Consumer Reports to decide which dishwasher to buy. But the Internet has (among other things) made it possible to learn about the opinions and experiences of those in the vast pool of people that are neither our personal acquaintances nor well-known professional critics --- that is, people we have never heard of. Enter sentiment analysis, a flourishing research area devoted to the computational treatment of subjective and opinion-oriented language. Sample phenomena to contend with range from sarcasm in blog postings to the interpretation of political speeches. This talk will cover some of the motivations, challenges, and approaches in this broad and exciting field."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_gosling_niederhofer_psm/,"Every action taken on a social media platform is performed by a psychological being trying to satisfy some kind of psychological need-that is, individuals use social media to meet their emotional, social, attitudinal, cognitive, behavioral, and identity needs. Media systems that adapt to these needs (which have evolved over many millions of years) will be more successful than those that do not.  This tutorial will present a range of theories and recent empirical research in social, personality, and cognitive psychology to inform research and design on social media platforms. For example, self-verification theory predicts that much social interaction is motivated not by people's need to be seen in a favorable light by others but by their needs to be seen by others as people see themselves; this prediction is supported by research examining perceptions of others based on their websites and Facebook profiles.  Person-environment theories can be used to understand the processes of selection, evocation, and manipulation by which people use social media platforms to improve the fit between themselves and their social, physical, and virtual environments. The presentation will be geared towards drawing design implications for social media systems and for providing psychological frameworks to guide data collection about the individuals and groups that use social media."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_sun_gmctfnf/,"Whether they are modeling bookmarking behavior in Flickr or cascades of failure in large networks, models of diffusion often start with the assumption that a few nodes start long chain reactions, resulting in large-scale cascades. While rea-sonable under some conditions, this assumption may not hold for social media networks, where user engagement is high and information may enter a system from multiple dis-connected sources. Using a dataset of 262,985 Facebook Pages and their as-sociated fans, this paper provides an empirical investigation of diffusion through a large social media network. Although Facebook diffusion chains are often extremely long (chains of up to 82 levels have been observed), they are not usually the result of a single chain-reaction event. Rather, these dif-fusion chains are typically started by a substantial number of users. Large clusters emerge when hundreds or even thousands of short diffusion chains merge together. This paper presents an analysis of these diffusion chains using zero-inflated negative binomial regressions. We show that after controlling for distribution effects, there is no meaningful evidence that a start node’s maximum diffusion chain length can be predicted with the user’s demographics or Facebook usage characteristics (including the user’s number of Facebook friends). This may provide insight into future research on public opinion formation."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_wei_soeac/,"This talk presents the first comprehensive exploration of the largest Chinese online knowledge sharing community- Baidu Knows. With analyzing 5.2 millions questions and 2.7 million users participated during 4.5 months on the site in 2008, we investigate how users adjust initial attempts and behave differently according to the level of participation; in particular, there is a positive dynamic for answerers to input more, be more focused, win more, and thus be rewarded more. As the result, a core user group forms to actively participate in both asking and answering across categories, thus maintaining a self-sufficient community. In addition, a prominent ""sense of community"" would enhance the social bonds within the community, especially for the contributors who can offer expertise but can rarely learn from others. The study suggests Baibu Knows as a successful design instance for further studies."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_mcglohon_csifu/,"Studying Usenet provides unique insight into online communities, since there is often a pre-defined space for community interaction. Here, we examine a large set of posts in nearly 200 politically-oriented newsgroups over a period of 4 years, using a unique and novel approach to the analysis. Our study is multi-scale: not only do we examine the newsgroups individually and compare measurements of different groups, but we also examine the relationships between the groups. Since users often post to multiple groups, shared participating authors or cross posts may be a way to assess how closely related, content-wise, two groups may be. However, this also causes some confusion of relevance. To combat this effect, we develop an “ownership” measure of an article to the set of cross-posted groups, based on the posting activity of the author. We show that this ownership measure can greatly improve assessment of information diffusion within and between groups, and suggest using it to improve analysis in other problems."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_gill_watba/,"Personal weblogs (blogs), provide individuals with the opportunity to write freely and express themselves online in the presence of others. In such situations, what do bloggers write about, and what are their motivations for blogging? Using a large blog corpus annotated with the LIWC text analysis program, we examine the content of blogs to provide insight into the role of personality in motivation for blogging. As predicted, we find that highly Neurotic authors use blogs to serve a cathartic or auto-therapeutic function, and reflect mainly upon themselves and negative emotions. Highly Extraverted blog authors, as expected, use blogs to document their lives at a high level, and uniquely interact directly with the reader. Additionally Extraverts use blogs to vent both positive and negative emotions. Bloggers who are high scorers on the Openness trait are more concerned with leisure activities, although they are more evaluative than intellectual, whereas high Conscientiousness bloggers tend to report daily life – and work – around them. As in other contexts, expressing positive rather than negative emotions is associated with high Agreeableness, but that trait is associated with self reference to a greater degree in blogs than elsewhere. In general, findings are consistent with other contexts indicating that bloggers tend to adapt to the possibilities of the medium, rather than try to present themselves differently"
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_agarwal_siaifs/,"We present a novel problem of searching for ‘familiar strangers’ in a social network. Familiar strangers are individuals who are not directly connected but exhibit some similarity. The power-law nature of social networks determines that majority of individuals are directly connected with a small number of fellow individuals, and similar individuals can be largely unknown to each other. Moreover, the individuals of a social network have only a local view of the network, which makes the problem of aggregating these familiar strangers a challenge. In this work, we formulate the problem, show why it is significant to address the challenge, and present an approach that innovatively employs the social identities of the individuals with competitive approaches. The blogger and citation network are used to showcase technical details and empirical results with related issues and future work."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_lieberman_yawye/,"Whether knowingly or otherwise, Wikipedia contributors reveal their interests and expertise through their contribution patterns. An analysis of Wikipedia edit histories shows that it is often possible to associate contributors with relatively small geographic regions, usually corresponding to where they were born or where they presently live. For many contributors, the geographic coordinates of pages they have edited are tightly clustered. Results suggest that a wealth of information about contributors can be gleaned from edit histories. This illustrates the efficacy of data mining on large, publicly-available datasets and raises potential privacy concerns."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_koutrika_crccss/,"Social sites are extremely popular among users but user interactions in most sites revolve around relatively simple tasks, such as uploading resources, tagging and poking friends. We believe that social sites can go beyond simple interactions among individuals and offer valuable services to well-defined, closed, communities (e.g., an academic, corporate or scientific community). In this paper, we present an example of a closed-community social system, CourseRank, an educational and social site where Stanford students can explore course offerings and plan their academic program. We perform an analysis of 12 months worth of CourseRank data including user contributed information, such as ratings and comments, as well as information extracted from the user logs, and we analyze several aspects of user interactions and user-contributed content in the site, such as activity levels, user behavior and user content quality. Our findings provide useful insights with respect to the potential of closed community social sites."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_tsur_rr/,"We present an algorithm for automatically ranking usergenerated book reviews according to review helpfulness. Given a collection of reviews, our REVRANK algorithm identifies a lexicon of dominant terms that constitutes the core of a virtual optimal review. This lexicon defines a feature vector representation. Reviews are then converted to this representation and ranked according to their distance from a ‘virtual core’ review vector. The algorithm is fully unsupervised and thus avoids costly and error-prone manual training annotations. Our experiments show that REVRANK clearly outperforms a baseline imitating the Amazon user vote review ranking system."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_hogg_smucws/,"We describe a general stochastic processes-based approach to modeling user-contributory web sites, where users create, rate and share content. These models describe aggregate measures of activity and how they arise from simple models of individual users. This approach provides a tractable method to understand user activity on the web site and how this activity depends on web site design choices, especially the choice of what information about other users' behaviors is shown to each user. We illustrate this modeling approach in the context of user-created content on the news rating site Digg."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_goetz_mbd/,"How do blogs produce posts? What local, underlying mechanisms lead to the bursty temporal behaviors observed in blog networks? Earlier work analyzed network patterns of blogs and found that blog behavior is bursty and often follows power laws in both topological and temporal characteristics. However, no intuitive and realistic model has yet been introduced, that can lead to such patterns. This is exactly the focus of this work. We propose a generative model that uses simple and intuitive principles for each individual blog, and yet it is able to produce the temporal characteristics of the blogosphere together with global topological network patterns, like power-laws for degree distributions, for inter-posting times, and several more. Our model ZC uses a novel ‘zero-crossing’ approach based on a random walk, combined with other powerful ideas like exploration and exploitation. This makes it the first model to simultaneously model the topology and temporal dynamics of the blogosphere. We validate our model with experiments on a large collection of 45,000 blogs and 2.2 million posts."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_munson_safidno/,"Aggregators rely on votes, and links to select and present subsets of the large quantity of news and opinion items gen- erated each day. Opinion and topic diversity in the output sets can provide individual and societal benefits, but simply selecting the most popular items may not yield as much di- versity as is present in the overall pool of votes and links. In this paper, we define three diversity metrics that ad- dress different dimensions of diversity: inclusion, non- alienation, and proportional representation. We then present the Sidelines algorithm – which temporarily suppresses a voter’s preferences after a preferred item has been selected – as one approach to increase the diversity of result sets. In comparison to collections of the most popular items, from user votes on Digg.com and links from a panel of political blogs, the Sidelines algorithm increased inclusion while de- creasing alienation. For the blog links, a set with known po- litical preferences, we also found that Sidelines improved proportional representation. In an online experiment using blog link data as votes, readers were more likely to find something challenging to their views in the Sidelines result sets. These findings can help build news and opinion aggre- gators that present users with a broader range of topics and opinions."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_cha_ffr/,"Blogs are a popular way to share personal journals, discuss matters of public opinion, pursue collaborative conversations, and aggregate content on similar topics. Blogs also disseminate new content and novel ideas to communities of interest. But how does content spread across these communities, what kinds of content spreads, and at what rate? This paper presents an analysis of the network structure and the spreading patterns of media content in the blogosphere. Based on 8.7 million posts in 1.1 million blogs across 15 major blog hosting sites, we show that the network structure of blogs is different from that of other online social networks: most links are unidirectional and the network is sparse. We also find that user generated content, often in the form of videos or photos, is the most common type of content shared in blogs. Focusing on the distribution of 10,000 popularly linked YouTube videos in blogs, we demonstrate how propagation patterns depend on content category. For example, the latest political news video immediately catches the attention of bloggers and fades away after a week, while a music video propagates slowly over a long period of time."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_gordon_ipsmwe/,"Stories of people's everyday experiences have long been the focus of psychology and sociology research, and are increasingly being used in innovative knowledge-based technologies. However, continued research in this area is hindered by the lack of standard corpora of sufficient size and by the costs of creating one from scratch. In this paper, we describe our efforts to develop a standard corpus for researchers in this area by identifying personal stories in the tens of millions of blog posts in the ICWSM 2009 Spinn3r Dataset. Our approach was to employ statistical text classification technology on the content of blog entries, which required the creation of a sufficiently large set of annotated training examples. We describe the development and evaluation of this classification technology and how it was applied to the dataset in order to identify nearly a million personal stories."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_sood_vasserman_esse/,"Future machines will connect with users on an emotional level in addition to performing complex computations (Norman 2004). In this article, we present a system that adds an emotional dimension to an activity that Internet users engage in frequently, search. ESSE, which stands for Emotional State Search Engine, is a web search engine that goes beyond facilitating a user’s exploration of the web by topic, as search engines such as Google or Yahoo! afford. Rather, it enables the user to browse their topically relevant search results by mood, providing the user with a unique perspective on the topic at hand. Consider a user wishing to read opinions about the new president of the United States. Typing “President Obama” into a Google search box will return (among other results), a few recent news stories about Obama, the Whitehouse’s website, as well as a wikipedia article about him. Typing “President Obama” into a Google Blog Search box will bring the user a bit closer to their goal in that all of the results are indeed blogs (typically opinions) about Obama. However, where blog search engines fall short is in providing users with a way to navigate and digest the vastness of the blogosphere, the incredible number of results for the query “President Obama” (approximately 17,335,307 as of 2/24/09) (Google Blog Search 2009). ESSE provides another dimension by which users can take in the vastness of the web or the blogosphere. This article outlines the contributions of ESSE including a new approach to mood classification."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_mejova_eitwc/,"Event tracking is the task of discovering temporal patterns of events from text streams. Existing approaches for event tracking have two limitations: scalability and their inability to rule out non-relevant portions within texts in the stream ‘relevant’ to the event of interest. In this study, we propose a novel approach to tackle these limitations. To demonstrate our approach, we track news events across a collection of weblogs spanning a two-month time period. In particular we track variations in the intensity of discussion on a given event over time. We demonstrate that our model is capable of tracking both events and sub-events at a finer granularity. We also present in this paper our analysis of the blog dataset distributed by the conference organizers."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_bolourian_qtppt/,"Blogs facilitate online debates and discussions for millions of people around the world. Identifying the most popular and prevailing topics discussed in the Blogosphere is a crucial task. This paper describes our novel approach to the quantification of the level of topic propagation in the Blogosphere. It tries to answer one key question: How many people should know about a subject before it becomes prevalent? Our model uses graph-theoretic representations of the Blogosphere’s link structures that allows it to deduce the ‘Percolation Threshold’, which is then used in the quantification and definition of a prevalent or ‘Global’ topic. We applied our approach and analysed the social structure of the ICWSM data collection to find the answer."
