This system has been running 24 hours/day for  over four years now. The result so far is a collection of 70  million interconnected beliefs (e.g., servedWith(coffee,  applePie), isA(applePie, bakedGood)), that NELL is  considering at different levels of confidence, along  with hundreds of thousands of learned phrasings,  morphological features, and web page structures that NELL  uses to extract beliefs from the web2 ."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2014_rei_large_scale/,"We present a semi-automatic data exploration and  organization tool. The system integrates machine learning  and text mining algorithms into an simple user interface and  a Client/Server architecture. The main features of the  systems include unsupervised and supervised methods for  concept suggestion, visualization and ability to make both  data and methods available to other applications as a  service."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2014_novalija_media_mining/,"This paper presents an approach to social media mining  based on a pipeline that implements observing, enriching,  storing, modeling and presentation techniques. While social  media mining solutions have been used for information  extraction and sentiment identification about certain topics,  applying social media for modeling and nowcasting is a  promising new research direction. A novel tool  TwitterObservatory that allows observing, searching,  analyzing and presenting social media is introduced as a  part of the research. Illustrative examples of using the  proposed pipeline show how the TwitterObservatory  implementing the pipeline can support the user in  interaction with the social media data."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2014_dimitrovski_data_visualization/,"Twitter is the leading micro-blogging and social network  service and is attracting an enormous amount of  attention in recent years. Users on Twitter generate an  abundance of information every day, establishing  Twitter as the focal point for analyzing and visualizing  social media data.  In this paper, we present a web tool for visualizing  Twitter data, TweetViz. TweetViz offers several different  kinds of visualizations that can pertain to a Twitter user  or any keyword or hashtag entered through the interface.  TweetViz also includes a so called Streamgraph  visualization that represents topic distribution in a set of tweets. The topic distributions are created using LDA  (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2014_dobsa_textual_documents/,"In this research is presented algorithm for classification  of textual documents which are represented in the space  of reduced dimension in respect to original bag of words  representation. Algorithm is carried out in two steps: in  the first step classification is conducted for documents  represented in original bag of words representation,  while in the second step classification is conducted for  documents represented in the space of reduced  dimension. Reduction of dimensionality is obtained also  in two steps: in the first step documents are represented  by usage of latent semantic indexing, while in the second  step this representation is projected on the space of  membership matrix defining a membership of  documents in classes. Evaluation of algorithm is  conducted on Reuters21578 collection of documents."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2014_brank_stream_documents/,"We present an efficient approach for clustering a massive stream  of textual documents, with particular emphasis on parallelization  by the means of multithreaded processing. The underlying  clustering algorithm is adaptable to changes in the stream and  includes the ability to split and merge clusters, as well as to  discard old data."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2014_zdravkova_multiword_expressions/,"One of the crucial challenges of statistical machine  translation is the lexical consistency of manually translated  words and multiword expressions (MWEs) with multiple  occurrences in the source language. In this paper, we present  the degree of translation inconsistency and we introduce the  index of translation completeness of fixed MWEs. The  research was based on the recently developed system that  intends to extract the entire candidate MWEs from Orwellâ€™s  1984 parallel corpora and to predict their translations  between English, Macedonian, and Slovene."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2014_kazic_event_detection/,"When dealing with large amounts of heterogeneous traffic  data streams, how a Complex Event Processing (CEP)  system, which can efficiently process and predict complex  events in traffic, is set up is a crucial matter. In this paper,  several issues and methods related to finding different rules  that can be used to develop such a system are presented.  Statistical methods to detect complex events from traffic  data are first described. Two types of techniques are used to  research relations between complex events: descriptive and  predictive data mining. First, association rules are used to  analyze data and express regularities in data. Second,  decision trees and decision rules algorithms are used for the  prediction of complex events.  All the algorithms were tested with regards to how different  social events affect the traffic system near the Stozice  stadium in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The results show that  methods described in this paper are feasible and can be  used for developing an advanced traveler information  system."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2014_kovacic_government_transparency/,"This paper presents usage of Supervizor, an online  application that provides information on financial  transactions of the public sector bodies. Supervizor  contains by now 50 mio. transactions from both  government and local agencies to government  contractors from 2003 to 2014 and matches such  transactions to company records from the Business  Register including director lists and corporate  leadership. The application, which has been designed  and developed by the Commission for the Prevention of  Corruption, won the UN Public Service Award in 2013,  an important recognition of excellence in public service.  The data on transactions from Supervizor are also  provided in machine readable form."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2014_hajdinjak_supply_data/,"This paper presents a data mining approach for demand  and supply data arising from economic statistics. It is  based on demand and supply functions with different  types of price elasticities, which can be used to identify  interesting patterns and data dependencies. Constant,  directly proportional and linear price elasticities are  considered."
