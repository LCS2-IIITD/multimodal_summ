http://videolectures.net/sikdd2018_novak_natural_language_processing/,"In education we can find millions of video, audio and text educational materials in different formats and languages. This variety and multimodality can impose difficulty on both students and teachers since it is hard to find the right materials that match their learning preferences. This paper presents an approach for retrieving and recommending items of different modalities. The main focus is on the retrieving and preprocessing pipeline, while the recommendation engine is based on the k-nearest neighbor method. We focus on educational materials, which can be text, audio or video, but the proposed procedure can be generalized on any type of multi-modal data."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2018_novalija_relation_tracker/,"In this paper, we present Relation Tracker, a tool that tracks main entities [people and organizations] within each topic through time. The main types of relations between the entities are detected and observed in time. The tool provides multiple ways of visualizing this information with different scales and durations. The tool uses events data from Event Registry as a source of information, with the aim of getting holistic insights about the searched topic"
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2018_novalija_labour_market_domain/,"In this paper, we present a proposal for developing smart labour market statistics based on streams of enriched textual data and illustrate its application on job vacancies from European countries. We define smart statistics scenarios including demand analysis scenario, skills ontology development scenario and skills ontology evolution scenario. We identify stakeholders – consumers for smart statistics and define the initial set of smart labour market statistical indicators"
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2018_urbancic_transporation_mode_detection/,"This paper addresses transportation mode detection for a mobile phone user using machine learning and based on mobile phone sensor data. We describe our approach to data collection, preprocessing and feature extraction. We evaluate our approach using random forest classification with focus on feature selection. We show that with feature selection we can significantly improve classification scores."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2018_jovanoski_anomaly_detection_approach/,"inter-connected, spanning over a range of computing devices. As software systems are being split into modules and services, coupled with an increasing parallelization, detecting and managing anomalies in such environments is hard. In practice, certain localized areas and subsystems provide strong monitoring support, but cross-system error-correlation, root-cause analysis and prediction are an elusive target. We propose a general approach to what we call Full-spectrum anomaly detection - an architecture that is able to detect local anomalies on data from various sources as well as creating high-level alerts utilizing background knowledge, historical data and forecast models. The methodology can be implemented either completely or partially."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2018_costa_support_public_health/,"Today’s society is data rich and information driven, with access to numerous data sources available that have the potential to provide new insights into areas such as disease prevention, personalised medicine and data driven policy decisions. This paper describes and demonstrates the use of text mining tools developed to support public health institutions to complement their data with other accessible open data sources, optimize analysis and gain insight when examining policy. In particular we focus on the exploration of MEDLINE, the biggest structured open dataset of biomedical knowledge. In MEDLINE we utilize its terminology for indexing and cataloguing biomedical information – MeSH – to maximize the efficacy of the dataset."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2018_koprivec_crop_classification/,"Efficient and accurate classification of land cover and land usage can be utilized in many different ways: ranging from natural resource management, agriculture support to legal and economic processes support. In this article, we present an implementation of land cover classiffication using the PerceptiveSentinel platform. Apart from using base 13 bands, only minor feature engineering was performed and different classiffication methods were explored. We report an F1 and accuracy score (80-90%) in range of state of the art when using pixel-wise classiffication and even comparable to time series based land cover  classiffication."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2018_kostovska_machine_learning_datasets/,"With the exponential growth of data in all areas of our lives, there is an increasing need of developing new approaches for effective data management. Namely, in the field of Data Mining (DM) and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), scientists often invest a lot of time and resources for collec- ting data that has already been acquired. In that context, by publishing open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data, researchers could reuse data that was previously collected, preprocessed and stored. Motivated by this, we conducted extensive review on current approaches, data repositories and semantic technologies used for annotation, storage and querying of datasets for the domain of machine learning (ML) and data mining. Finally, we identify the limitations of the existing repositories of datasets and propose a design of a semantic data repository that adheres to FAIR principles for data management and stewardship."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2018_tolovski_data_mining_models/,"Semantic annotation provides machine readable structure to the stored data. We can use this structure to perform semantic querying, based on explicitly and implicitly derived information. In this paper, we focus on the approaches in semantic annotation, storage and querying in the context of data mining models and experiments. Having semantically annotated data mining models and experiments with terms from domain ontologies and vocabularies will enable researchers to verify, reproduce, and reuse the produced artefacts and with that improve the current research. Here, we first provide an overview of state-of-the-art approaches in the area of semantic web, data mining domain ontologies and vocabularies, experiment databases, representation of data mining models and experiments, and annotation frameworks. Next, we critically discuss the presented state-of-the-art. Further-more, we sketch our proposal for an ontology-based system for semantic annotation, storage, and querying of data mining models and experiments. Finally, we conclude the paper with a summary and future work."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2018_kresz_prediction_model/,"We present a new model for probabilistic forecasting using graph-based rating method. We provide a \forward-looking"" type graph-based approach and apply it to predict football game outcomes by simply using the historical game results data of the investigated competition. The assumption of our model is that the rating of the teams after a game day correctly reflects the actual relative performance of them. We consider that the smaller the changing of the rating vector {contains the ratings of each team { after a certain outcome in an upcoming single game, the higher the probability of that outcome. Performing experiments on European foot- ball championships data, we can observe that the model performs well in general and outperforms some of the advanced versions of the widely-used Bradley-Terry model in many cases in terms of predictive accuracy. Although the application we present here is special, we note that our method can be applied to forecast general graph processes."
