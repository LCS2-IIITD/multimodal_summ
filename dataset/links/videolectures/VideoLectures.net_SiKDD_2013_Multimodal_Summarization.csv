http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_novalija_fashion_collection/,"This paper presents an approach to developing a fashion domain ontology based on inputs from fashion experts and natural language processing (NLP) methods. While many of software solutions for fashion industry are concentrated on the design, manufacturing and trading applications, semantic technologies are just starting to interact with fashion domain. Domain ontologies allow capturing, sharing, analyzing and reusing the important information from the defined field."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_herga_support_prototype/,"The purpose of this paper is to present the approach to knowledge acquisition and computer reasoning support in a call center environment. The common problem in such environments (especially in technical call centers) is that the call operators are usually just the interface to the experts inside the company. They often lack the detailed technical knowledge in the field of study, especially when they are newcomers who just started with their job. For this reason we developed the expert system (ES) that is able to obtain needed expertise from technical staff and it is able to assist less technically versed operators to provide feedback to customers and acquire the knowledge needed to fix the particular customer problem. The prototype implementation of the ES was built for the national roadside assistance call center which is focused on car fault diagnosis."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_starc_relation_arguments/,"In this paper, we propose an iterative semi-automatic approach for linking textual arguments of relations to their semantic form using rules. Textual arguments are completely decomposed – every word is considered. They are composed back into semantic form using functions, which bring additional semantic information. The process starts with an initial set of seed rules, which can be obtained automatically. In each iteration, the user constructs new rules using the recommendations, which are calculated based on the frequency statistics of unlinked textual arguments. Our approach was tested on extraction of roles that people have in organizations. The results show that only 31 human crafted rules are needed to link more than 3400 additional arguments. We also show that combining rules have positive effects. The number of linked arguments grows super-linearly with respect to the number of patterns."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_dali_news_search/,"In this paper we study the problem of guessing what search query the user intends to type into a search engine based on the first few characters of the query, also known as prefix based query auto-completion. We train and evaluate two personalized auto-completion models on search logs from an online news portal. The personalization comes from using demographic and location information specific to the user. Our experiments show that we can guess the query the user intended to type and rank it among the top three suggestions over 75 % of the time. Moreover, the methods described can decrease the number of keystrokes by about 40%, thus saving the user a lot of typing."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_speh_dirichlet_allocation/,"We review three algorithms for parameter estimation of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model: batch variational Bayesian inference, online variational Bayesian inference and inference using collapsed Gibbs sampling. We experimentally compare their time complexity and performance. We find that the online variational Bayesian inference converges faster than the other two inference techniques, with comparable quality of the results."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_moraru_tweets_events/,"Social events happening in a city can influence and affect a large number of the citizens, directly or indirectly involved. Having a metric to measure the popularity of such events can help in estimating the resources needed for handling them, improving facilities such as public transportation or traffic estimations. This paper reports on the problem of association of Tweet messages to social events in order to discover the popularity of an event. We propose and evaluate a method that computes an association coefficient for an event-tweet pair and discuss the results obtained."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_kenda_kalman_filter/,"This paper presents a methodology for data cleaning of sensor data using the Kalman filter. The Kalman filter is an on-line algorithm and as such is ideal for usage on the sensor data streams. The Kalman filter learns parameters of a user-specified underlying model which models the phenomena the sensor is measuring. Usage of the Kalman filter is proposed to predict the expected values of the measuring process in the near future and to detect the anomalies in the data stream. Furthermore the Kalman filter prediction can be used to replace missing or invalid values in the data stream. Algorithm only requires sensor measurements as an input, which makes it ideal to be placed as near to the resource tier in the N-tier architecture as possible."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_kenda_asset_management/,"This paper presents the conceptual architecture of the system for optimization of maintenance of assets that are equipped with adequate sensors. Beside the conceptual architecture we also present our implementation in the telecommunications use case, where we developed a system that helps optimizing technician response time and reduces effort needed for resolving problems with maintaining the mobile telephony base stations."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_kazic_activity_recognition/,"The focus of this work is to explore the possibilities of recognizing three common user activities (sitting, walking and running) with accelerometer data from smartphones. Among five common machine learning algorithms, Naïve Bayes classifier proved to be the best choice. Classification accuracy of more than 90% was achieved when phone is carried in a pocket. It is shown that this method is appropriate and that the phone’s orientation information is not needed. Finally, the classification of one day-long data set is presented."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_trampus_bercic_diversified_news/,"With the ever-increasing ease and speed of opinion exchange, the internet often displays the echo chamber effect. This is exacerbated by a free market: search engines and other data aggregators are monetarily incentivized to primarily show the most popular opinions. We propose a data aggregation, processing and retrieval system to combat this phenomenon in the domain of web news. We developed two applications (web, iOS) that allow users to explore news articles along several uncommon imensions, diversifying them and discovering new aspects of a story. The iOS application works in real time, making for a novel alternative to classic news reader apps. Our user study shows a need for such diversity-aware approaches and judges our solution to be directly useful."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2013_niaksu_multirelational_settings/,The paper deals with a distance based multi-relational clustering application in a real data case study. A novel method for a dissimilarity matrix calculation in multi-relational settings has been proposed and implemented in R language. The proposed method has been tested by analyzing public actions related to data mining subject and indexed in the medical index database MedLine. Clustering based on partitioning around methods was used for the semi-automated identification of the most popular topics among the MedLine publications. The algorithm implements greedy approach and is suitable for small data sets with a limited number of 1:n relational joins.
