Video_Presentation,Abstracts
http://videolectures.net/wsdm08_najork_weint/,"WSDM (pronounced “wisdom”) is a brand new ACM conference intended to be complementary to the World Wide Web Conference tracks in search and data mining. The pace of innovation in these areas has reached a level that requires more than one premier annual venue. Specifically, substantial work is currently being done in the areas of workload-driven crawling and monitoring, security and privacy, user profiling, personalized search and ranking, Web advertising, social media analysis, and spam detection. WSDM was first conceived in early 2006, and made reality by the efforts of many members of the search and data mining community. The conference owes a special debt of gratitude to Ziv Bar -Yossef, who nurtured the conference from conception to realization."

I will not give a survey of all work in the area; instead I will give my personal perspective based on work in the InfoLab at Stanford. In particular, I will touch on our lab's work on crawling, indexing, ranking, personalization, and more recently on spam detection and social networking."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm08_heymann_csbiws/,"Social bookmarking is a recent phenomenon which has the potential to give us a great deal of data about pages on the web. One major question is whether that data can be used to augment systems like web search. To answer this question, over the past year we have gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yet analyzed by academic researchers. Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarks from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us. We contribute a characterization of posts to del.icio.us: how many bookmarks exist (about 115 million), how fast is it growing, and how active are the URLs being posted about (quite active). We also contribute a characterization of tags used by bookmarkers. We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certain domains, and vice versa. We also found that tags occur in over 50 percent of the pages that they annotate, and in only 20 percent of cases do they not occur in the page text, backlink page text, or forward link page text of the pages they annotate. We conclude that social bookmarking can provide search data not currently provided by other sources, though it may currently lack the size and distribution of tags necessary to make a significant impact."
