This perspective will range from personal experience in academic research in the Semantic Web community  to applications and uptake of knowledge graphs in industry. The talk will be presented as a knowledge graph itself –  with real-life data and examples to be interactively explored and to see what is possible with knowledge graph technology today. Peter has a long history in the Semantic Web community, his first contacts with semantic technologies dating back 20 years.  In 2006, Peter obtained his PhD from the University of Karlsruhe (now KIT) under the supervision of Prof. Rudi Studer.  He then worked as Head of Research and Development at fluid Operations, a startup in the area of semantic data management and enterprise cloud management. In 2014, Peter founded metaphacts, focusing on enterprise knowledge graphs. Share on"
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_maynard_value_nlp/,"Natural language processing technology is now ubiquitous, even if there are still many challenges to be faced in its development. From sentiment analysis to machine translation to chatbots; from medical systems to online shopping to fake news; even if not visibly apparent, NLP tools are now lurking hidden in the depths of an enormous number and range of real-world systems and applications. Techniques have advanced in many directions in the last 20 years thanks primarily to developments in machine learning and deep learning technologies, and to the concomitant creation of and attention to language resources. In this talk, I shall examine the role of semantics in NLP applications. It is perhaps surprising that despite recent advances in Semantic Web technology and NLP, researchers and practitioners in domains ranging from journalism to rocket science have yet to grasp their potential, and are still manually grappling feral spreadsheets and databases. I shall discuss how NLP infused with even small amounts of semantics can be a drastic game-changer in fields as diverse as crisis communication, politics, journalism, medicine, literature, and history, using examples from some of our recent projects and applications."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_quercia_healthy_cities/,"We will see how to aggregate both readings from consumer wearable devices and records of food purchases to track people’s well-being at scale. From 11,600 Nokia Health wearables, we collected readings of steps, sleep, and heart rate in the entire cities of London and San Francisco over the course of 1 year. Christmas and New Year’s eve were associated only with short-lived and minor disruptions, while both Brexit and Trump’s election greatly impacted people’s sleep and even heart rates. Then, for another entire year in London, we studied the association between food purchases in grocery stores, as measured by the digital traces of customer loyalty cards, and consumption of medicines. Our results show that analytics of digital records of grocery purchases can be used as a cheap and scalable tool for health surveillance: the distribution of the food nutrients is far more predictive of food-related illnesses (e.g., diabetes) than socio-economic conditions.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_ayala_aynec_graphs/,"The popularity of knowledge graphs has led to the development of techniques to refine them and increase their quality. One of the main refinement tasks is completion (also known as link prediction for knowledge graphs), which seeks to add missing triples to the graph, usually by classifying potential ones as true or false. While there is a wide variety of graph completion techniques, there is no standard evaluation setup, so each proposal is evaluated using different datasets and metrics. In this paper we present AYNEC, a suite for the evaluation of knowledge graph completion techniques that covers the entire evaluation workflow. It includes a customisable tool for the generation of datasets with multiple variation points related to the preprocessing of graphs, the splitting into training and testing examples, and the generation of negative examples. AYNEC also provides a visual summary of the graph and the optional exportation of the datasets in an open format for their visualisation. We use AYNEC to generate a library of datasets ready to use for evaluation purposes based on several popular knowledge graphs. Finally, it includes a tool that computes relevant metrics and uses significance tests to compare each pair of techniques. These open source tools, along with the datasets, are freely available to the research community and will be maintained."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_fathalla_eventskg_star/,"Metadata of scientific events has become increasingly available on the Web, albeit often as raw data in various formats, disregarding its semantics and interlinking relations. This leads to restricting the usability of this data for, e.g., subsequent analyses and reasoning. Therefore, there is a pressing need to represent this data in a semantic representation, i.e., Linked Data. We present the new release of the EVENTSKG dataset, comprising comprehensive semantic descriptions of scientific events of eight computer science communities. Currently, EVENTSKG is a 5-star dataset containing metadata of 73 top-ranked event series (almost 2,000 events) established over the last five decades. The new release is a Linked Open Dataset adhering to an updated version of the Scientific Events Ontology, a reference ontology for event metadata representation, leading to richer and cleaner data. To facilitate the maintenance of EVENTSKG and to ensure its sustainability, EVENTSKG is coupled with a Java API that enables users to add/update events metadata without going into the details of the representation of the dataset. We shed light on events characteristics by analyzing EVENTSKG data, which provides a flexible means for customization in order to better understand the characteristics of renowned CS events."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_zloch_software_framework/,"As the availability and the inter-connectivity of RDF datasets grow, so does the necessity to understand the structure of the data. Understanding the topology of RDF graphs can guide and inform the development of, e.g. synthetic dataset generators, sampling methods, index structures, or query optimizers. In this work, we propose two resources: (i) a software framework (Resource URL of the framework: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2109469) able to acquire, prepare, and perform a graph-based analysis on the topology of large RDF graphs, and (ii) results on a graph-based analysis of 280 datasets (Resource URL of the datasets: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1214433) from the LOD Cloud with values for 28 graph measures computed with the framework. We present a preliminary analysis based on the proposed resources and point out implications for synthetic dataset generators. Finally, we identify a set of measures, that can be used to characterize graphs in the Semantic Web."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_rizzo_boosting_concepts/,"We present a method for boosting relational classifiers of individual resources in the context of the Web of Data. We show how weak classifiers induced by simple concept learners can be enhanced producing strong classification models from training datasets. Even more so the comprehensibility of the model is to some extent preserved as it can be regarded as a sort of concept in disjunctive form. We demonstrate the application of this approach to a weak learner that is easily derived from learners that search a space of hypotheses, requiring an adaptation of the underlying heuristics to take into account weighted training examples. An experimental evaluation on a variety of artificial learning problems and datasets shows that the proposed approach enhances the performance of the basic learners and is competitive, outperforming current concept learning systems."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_gupta_semantic_aspects/,"Large document collections can be hard to explore if the user presents her information need in a limited set of keywords. Ambiguous intents arising out of these short queries often result in long-winded query sessions and many query reformulations. To alleviate this problem, in this work, we propose the novel concept of semantic aspects (e.g.,   ⟨{𝗆𝗂𝖼𝗁𝖺𝖾𝗅\𝗍𝖾𝗑𝗍 {-}𝗉𝗁𝖾𝗅𝗉𝗌},{𝖺𝗍𝗁𝖾𝗇𝗌, 𝖻𝖾𝗂𝗃𝗂𝗇𝗀, 𝗅𝗈𝗇𝖽𝗈𝗇},[2004,2016]⟩  for the ambiguous query  Open image in new window) and present the xFactor algorithm that generates them from annotations in documents. Semantic aspects uplift document contents into a meaningful structured representation, thereby allowing the user to sift through many documents without the need to read their contents. The semantic aspects are created by the analysis of semantic annotations in the form of temporal, geographic, and named entity annotations. We evaluate our approach on a novel testbed of over 5,000 aspects on Web-scale document collections amounting to more than 450 million documents. Our results show the xFactor algorithm finds relevant aspects for highly ambiguous queries."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_buron_reformulation_ontologies/,"Query answering in RDF knowledge bases has traditionally been performed either through graph saturation, i.e., adding all implicit triples to the graph, or through query reformulation, i.e., modifying the query to look for the explicit triples entailing precisely what the original query asks for. The most expressive fragment of RDF for which Reformulation-based quey answering exists is the so-called database fragment [12], in which implicit triples are restricted to those entailed using an RDFS ontology. Within this fragment, query answering was so far limited to the interrogation of data triples (non-RDFS ones); however, a powerful feature specific to RDF is the ability to query data and schema triples together. In this paper, we address the general query answering problem by reducing it, through a pre-query reformulation step, to that solved by the query reformulation technique of [12]. We also report on experiments demonstrating the low cost of our reformulation algorithm."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_thornton_shape_expressions/,"We discuss Shape Expressions (ShEx), a concise, formal, modeling and validation language for RDF structures. For instance, a Shape Expression could prescribe that subjects in a given RDF graph that fall into the shape “Paper” are expected to have a section called “Abstract”, and any ShEx implementation can confirm whether that is indeed the case for all such subjects within a given graph or subgraph. There are currently five actively maintained ShEx implementations. We discuss how we use the JavaScript, Scala and Python implementations in RDF data validation workflows in distinct, applied contexts. We present examples of how ShEx can be used to model and validate data from two different sources, the domain-specific Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and the domain-generic Wikidata knowledge base, which is the linked database built and maintained by the Wikimedia Foundation as a sister project to Wikipedia. Example projects that are using Wikidata as a data curation platform are presented as well, along with ways in which they are using ShEx for modeling and validation. When reusing RDF graphs created by others, it is important to know how the data is represented. Current practices of using human-readable descriptions or ontologies to communicate data structures often lack sufficient precision for data consumers to quickly and easily understand data representation details. We provide concrete examples of how we use ShEx as a constraint and validation language that allows humans and machines to communicate unambiguously about data assets. We use ShEx to exchange and understand data models of different origins, and to express a shared model of a resource’s footprint in a Linked Data source. We also use ShEx to agilely develop data models, test them against sample data, and revise or refine them. The expressivity of ShEx allows us to catch disagreement, inconsistencies, or errors efficiently, both at the time of input, and through batch inspections."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_buzio_tinderbook_love/,"More than 2 millions of new books are published every year and choosing a good book among the huge amount of available options can be a challenging endeavor. Recommender systems help in choosing books by providing personalized suggestions based on the user reading history. However, most book recommender systems are based on collaborative filtering, involving a long onboarding process that requires to rate many books before providing good recommendations. Tinderbook provides book recommendations, given a single book that the user likes, through a card-based playful user interface that does not require an account creation. Tinderbook is strongly rooted in semantic technologies, using the DBpedia knowledge graph to enrich book descriptions and extending a hybrid state-of-the-art knowledge graph embeddings algorithm to derive an item relatedness measure for cold start recommendations. Tinderbook is publicly available (http://www.tinderbook.it) and has already generated interest in the public, involving passionate readers, students, librarians, and researchers. The online evaluation shows that Tinderbook achieves almost 50% of precision of the recommendations."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_Cifuentes_Gayo_law/,"This paper describes the system architecture for generating the History of the Law developed for the Chilean National Library of Congress (BCN). The production system uses Semantic Web technologies, Akoma-Ntoso, and tools that automate the marking of plain text to XML, enriching and linking documents. These documents semantically annotated allow to develop specialized political and legislative services, and to extract knowledge for a Legal Knowledge Base for public use. We show the strategies used for the implementation of the automatic markup tools, as well as describe the knowledge graph generated from semantic documents. Finally, we show the contrast between the time of document processing using semantic technologies versus manual tasks, and the lessons learnt in this process, installing a base for the replication of a technological model that allows the generation of useful services for diverse contexts."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_ristoski_explore_exploit/,"Many Knowledge Extraction systems rely on semantic resources - dictionaries, ontologies, lexical resources - to extract information from unstructured text. A key for successful information extraction is to consider such resources as evolving artifacts and keep them up-to-date. In this paper, we tackle the problem of dictionary expansion and we propose a human-in-the-loop approach: we couple neural language models with tight human supervision to assist the user in building and maintaining domain-specific dictionaries. The approach works on any given input text corpus and is based on the explore and exploit paradigm: starting from a few seeds (or an existing dictionary) it effectively discovers new instances (explore) from the text corpus as well as predicts new potential instances which are not in the corpus, i.e. “unseen”, using the current dictionary entries (exploit). We evaluate our approach on five real-world dictionaries, achieving high accuracy with a rapid expansion rate."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_ercan_textual_evidence/,"Knowledge graphs have become vital resources for semantic search and provide users with precise answers to their information needs. Knowledge graphs often consist of billions of facts, typically encoded in the form of RDF triples. In most cases, these facts are extracted automatically and can thus be susceptible to errors. For many applications, it can therefore be very useful to complement knowledge graph facts with textual evidence. For instance, it can help users make informed decisions about the validity of the facts that are returned as part of an answer to a query. In this paper, we therefore propose  Open image in new window, an approach that given a knowledge graph and a text corpus, retrieves the top-k most relevant textual passages for a given set of facts. Since our goal is to retrieve short passages, we develop a set of IR models combining exact matching through the Okapi BM25 model with semantic matching using word embeddings. To evaluate our approach, we built an extensive benchmark consisting of facts extracted from YAGO and text passages retrieved from Wikipedia. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in retrieving textual evidence for knowledge graph facts."

Its goal is to improve efficiency and reliability of data integration to support government decision making."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_hyvonen_biographysampo_biographies/,"This paper argues for making a paradigm shift in publishing and using biographical dictionaries on the web, based on Linked Data. The idea is to provide the user with enhanced reading experience of biographies by enriching contents with data linking and reasoning. In addition, versatile tooling for (1) biographical research of individual persons as well as for (2) prosopographical research on groups of people are provided. To demonstrate and evaluate the new possibilities, we present the semantic portal “BiographySampo – Finnish Biographies on the Semantic Web”. The system is based on a knowledge graph extracted automatically from a collection of 13 100 textual biographies, enriched with data linking to 16 external data sources, and by harvesting external collection data from libraries, museums, and archives. The portal was released in September 2018 for free public use at http://biografiasampo.fi."

The core classes and relationships forming the ontology are discussed in detail. The ToCo ontology can describe the physical infrastructure, quality of channel, services and users in heterogeneous telecommunication networks which span multiple technology domains. The DIL pattern is observed and summarised when modelling networks with various technology domains. Examples and use cases of ToCo are presented for demonstration."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_rossiello_latent_relational/,"Analogy is a fundamental component of the way we think and process thought. Solving a word analogy problem, such as mason is to stone as carpenter is to wood, requires capabilities in recognizing the implicit relations between the two word pairs. In this paper, we describe the analogy problem from a computational linguistics point of view and explore its use to address relation extraction tasks. We extend a relational model that has been shown to be effective in solving word analogies and adapt it to the relation extraction problem. Our experiments show that this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a relation extraction dataset, opening up a new research direction in discovering implicit relations in text through analogical reasoning."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_huang_learning_uri/,"As the Web of Linked Open Data is growing the problem of crawling that cloud becomes increasingly important. Unlike normal Web crawlers, a Linked Data crawler performs a selection to focus on collecting linked RDF (including RDFa) data on the Web. From the perspectives of throughput and coverage, given a newly discovered and targeted URI, the key issue of Linked Data crawlers is to decide whether this URI is likely to dereference into an RDF data source and therefore it is worth downloading the representation it points to. Current solutions adopt heuristic rules to filter irrelevant URIs. Unfortunately, when the heuristics are too restrictive this hampers the coverage of crawling. In this paper, we propose and compare approaches to learn strategies for crawling Linked Data on the Web by predicting whether a newly discovered URI will lead to an RDF data source or not. We detail the features used in predicting the relevance and the methods we evaluated including a promising adaptation of FTRL-proximal online learning algorithm. We compare several options through extensive experiments including existing crawlers as baseline methods to evaluate their efficacy."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_scioscia_owl_reasoner/,"Mobile reasoners play a pivotal role in the so-called Semantic Web of Things. While several tools exist for the Android platform, iOS has been neglected so far. This is due to architectural differences and unavailability of OWL manipulation libraries, which make porting existing engines harder. This paper presents Mini-ME Swift, the first Description Logics reasoner for iOS. It implements standard (Subsumption, Satisfiability, Classification, Consistency) and non-standard (Abduction, Contraction, Covering, Difference) inferences in an OWL 2 fragment. Peculiarities are discussed and performance results are presented, comparing Mini-ME Swift with other state-of-the-art OWL reasoners."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_kacfah_legal_ontologies/,"Many standards exist to formalize legal texts and rules. The same is true for legal ontologies. However, there is no proof theory to draw conclusions for these ontologically modeled rules. We address this gap by the proposal of a new modeling of deontic statements, and then we use this modeling to propose reasoning mechanisms to answer deontic questions i.e., questions like “Is it mandatory/permitted/prohibited to...”. We also show that using this modeling, it is possible to check the consistency of a deontic rule base. This work stands as a first important step towards a proof theory over a deontic rule base."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2019_gao_hybrid_graph/,"Distant supervision has advantages of generating training data automatically for relation extraction by aligning triples in Knowledge Graphs with large-scale corpora. Some recent methods attempt to incorporate extra information to enhance the performance of relation extraction. However, there still exist two major limitations. Firstly, these methods are tailored for a specific type of information which is not enough to cover most of the cases. Secondly, the introduced extra information may contain noise. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid graph model, which can incorporate heterogeneous background information in a unified framework, such as entity types and human-constructed triples. These various kinds of knowledge can be integrated efficiently even with several missing cases. In addition, we further employ an attention mechanism to identify the most confident information which can alleviate the side effect of noise. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in various evaluation metrics."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_manolescu_semantic_graphs/,"RDF graphs comprise highly complex data, both from a structural and from a semantic perspective. This makes them hard to discover and learn, and hinders their usability. An elegant basis for summarizing graphs is provided by the graph quotient formalism. In a nutshell, a graph quotient specifies a way to view some graph nodes as equivalent to each other, and represents a graph through its equivalence classes based on this equivalence. I will present work carried in my last team over the last few years, on quotient summarization of semantic-rich RDF graph. In particular, I will introduce a set of summaries particularly suited for the heterogeneous structure of RDF graphs, and discuss novel results at the interplay of summarization and saturation with RDF Schema rules"
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_rudolph_knowledge_representation/,"With the rise of the Semantic Web and in the course of the standardization of ontology languages, logic-based knowledge representation (KR) has received wide attention from academics and practitioners alike. This talk will present a – necessarily subjective – view on the role of KR in the context of the Semantic Web. It will make a case for rigid logical underpinnings with principled analyses of expressivity and computational properties (like decidability or complexity) of KR formalisms, but also discuss the challenges that the KR community has to address in order to ensure the ongoing uptake of modern KR technology by the wider Semantic Web public and IT business in general."

http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_kipf_convolutional_networks/,"Knowledge graphs enable a wide variety of applications, including question answering and information retrieval. Despite the great effort invested in their creation and maintenance, even the largest (e.g., Yago, DBPedia or Wikidata) remain incomplete. We introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) and apply them to two standard knowledge base completion tasks: Link prediction (recovery of missing facts, i.e. subject-predicate-object triples) and entity classification (recovery of missing entity attributes). R-GCNs are related to a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, and are developed specifically to handle the highly multi-relational data characteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification. We further show that factorization models for link prediction such as DistMult can be significantly improved through the use of an R-GCN encoder model to accumulate evidence over multiple inference steps in the graph, demonstrating a large improvement of 29.8% on FB15k-237 over a decoder-only baseline."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_rettinger_unseen_objects/,"Images on the Web encapsulate diverse knowledge about varied abstract concepts. They cannot be sufficiently described with models learned from image-caption pairs that mention only a small number of visual object categories. In contrast, large-scale knowledge graphs contain many more concepts that can be detected by image recognition models. Hence, to assist description generation for those images which contain visual objects unseen in image-caption pairs, we propose a two-step process by leveraging large-scale knowledge graphs. In the first step, a multi-entity recognition model is built to annotate images with concepts not mentioned in any caption. In the second step, those annotations are leveraged as external semantic attention and constrained inference in the image description generation model. Evaluations show that our models outperform most of the prior work on out-of-domain MSCOCO image description generation and also scales better to broad domains with more unseen objects."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_piao_transfer_learning/,"With the popularity of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in recent years, there have been many studies leveraging the abundant background knowledge available in KGs for the task of item recommendations. However, little attention has been paid to the incompleteness of KGs when leveraging knowledge from them. In addition, previous studies have mainly focused on exploiting knowledge from a KG for item recommendations, and it is unclear whether we can exploit the knowledge in the other way, i.e, whether user-item interaction histories can be used for improving the performance of completing the KG with regard to the domain of items. In this paper, we investigate the effect of knowledge transfer between two tasks: (1) item recommendations, and (2) KG completion, via a co-factorization model (CoFM) which can be seen as a transfer learning model. We evaluate CoFM by comparing it to three competitive baseline methods for each task. Results indicate that considering the incompleteness of a KG outperforms other compared methods, including a state-of-the-art factorization method leveraging existing knowledge from the KG. In addition, the results show that exploiting user-item interaction histories also improves the performance of completing the KG with regard to the domain of items, which has not been studied before"

Specifically, a concept graph for geographical Gaokao is automatically constructed from textbook tables and Chinese wiki encyclopedia, to capture the core concepts and relations in geography. Based on this concept graph, a graph search based question answering approach is designed to find explainable inference paths between questions and answer choices. We developed an online system called CGQA and conducted experiments on two real datasets created from the last ten year geographical Gaokao.

GSP exploits powerful machine learning algorithms on top of the rich, interconnected Linked Data in order to overcome limitations of previous state-of-the-art approaches. In detail, our technique performs semantic annotation to identify relevant tokens in the input document, traverses a sub-graph of Linked Data for extracting possible geographic information related to the identified tokens, and optimizes its results by means of a Support Vector Machine classifier. We compare our results with those of 4 state-of-the-art techniques and baselines, on ground-truth data from 2 evaluation datasets.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_thieblin_evaluation_sets/,"Simple ontology alignments, largely studied, link one entity from a source ontology to one entity of a target ontology. One of the limitations of these alignments is, however, their lack of expressiveness which can be overcome by complex alignments. Although different complex matching approaches have emerged in the literature, there is a lack of complex reference alignments on which these approaches can be systematically evaluated. This paper proposes two sets of complex alignments between 10 pairs of ontologies from the well-known OAEI conference simple alignment dataset. The proposed alignments involve equivalence correspondences linking single entities of a source ontology to constructions of entities of the target ontology. The methodology for creating the alignment sets is described and takes into account the use of the alignments for two tasks: ontology merging and query rewriting. The ontology merging alignment set contains 313 correspondences and the query rewriting one 431. We report an evaluation of state-of-the art complex matchers on these proposed alignment sets."

http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_gottschalk_knowledge_graph/,"One of the key requirements to facilitate semantic analytics of information regarding contemporary and historical events on the Web, in the news and in social media is the availability of reference knowledge repositories containing comprehensive representations of events and temporal relations.

EventKG presented in this paper is a multilingual event-centric temporal knowledge graph that aims to address this gap. EventKG incorporates over 690 thousand contemporary and historical events and over 2.3 million temporal relations extracted from several large-scale knowledge graphs and less structured sources and makes this information available through a canonical representation.In this paper we present EventKG including its data model, extraction process, and characteristics and discuss its relevance for several real-world applications including Question Answering, timeline generation and cross-cultural analytics."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_eko_prasojo_semantic_triples/,"Summarizing news articles is becoming crucial for allowing quick and concise access to information about daily events. This task can be challenging when the same event is reported with various levels of detail or is subject to diverse view points. A well established technique in the area of news summarization consists in modeling events as a set of semantic triples. These triples are weighted, mainly based on their frequencies, and then fused to build summaries. Typically, these triples are extracted from main clauses which might lead to information loss. Moreover, some crucial facets of news, such as reasons or consequences, are mostly reported in subordinate clauses and thus, they are not properly handled. In this paper, we focus on an existing work that uses a graph structure to model sentences allowing the access to any triple independently from the clause it belongs to. Summary sentences are then generated by taking the top ranked paths that contain many triples and show grammatical correctness. We further provide several improvements to such approach. First, we leverage node degrees for finding the most important triples and facets shared among sentences. Second, we enhance the process of triple fusion by providing more effective similarity measures that exploit entity linking and predicate similarity. We performed extensive experiments using DUC2004 and DUC2007 datasets showing that our approach outperforms baseline approaches by a large margin in terms of ROUGE and PYRAMID scores."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_noorani_bakerally_data_platforms/,"Linked Data Platform 1.0 (LDP) is the W3C Recommendation for exposing linked data in a RESTful manner. While there are several implementations of the LDP standard, deploying an LDP is still complex is tighly coupled to the chosen implementation. As a consequence, the same design (in terms of how the data is organised) is difficult to reuse in different LDP deployments. We propose a language for specifying how existing data should be used to generate LDP resources in a way that is independent of and compatible with any LDP implementation. We formally describe the syntax and semantics of the language and its implementation. We show that our approach allows the reuse of the same design for multiple deployments, or reuse the same data with different design, is open to heterogeneous data sources, can cope with hosting constraints and significantly automatize deployment of LDPs."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_georgala_link_discovery/,"With the growth of the number and the size of RDF datasets comes an increasing need for scalable solutions to support the linking of resources. Most Link Discovery frameworks rely on complex link specifications for this purpose. We address the scalability of the execution of link specifications by presenting the first dynamic planning approach for Link Discovery dubbed Condor. In contrast to the state of the art, Condor can re-evaluate and reshape execution plans for link specifications during their execution. Thus, it achieves significantly better runtimes than existing planning solutions while retaining an F-measure of 100%. We quantify our improvement by evaluating our approach on 7 datasets and 700 link specifications. Our results suggest that Condor is up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art and requires less than 0.1% of the total runtime of a given specification to generate the corresponding plan"

A lot of this data is available through APIs serving JSON documents. In this work we propose a way of extending SPARQL with the option to consume JSON APIs and integrate the obtained information into SPARQL query answers, thus obtaining a query language allowing to bring data from the “traditional” Web to the Semantic Web. Looking to evaluate these queries as efficiently as possible, we show that the main bottleneck is the amount of API requests, and present an algorithm that produces “worst-case optimal” query plans that reduce the number of requests as much as possible. We also do a set of experiments that empirically confirm the optimality of our approach."

This paper introduces a new method based on a deep neural network combining convolutional and gated recurrent networks. We conduct an extensive evaluation of the method against several baselines and state of the art on the largest collection of publicly available Twitter datasets to date, and show that compared to previously reported results on these datasets, our proposed method is able to capture both word sequence and order information in short texts, and it sets new benchmark by outperforming on 6 out of 7 datasets by between 1 and 13 percents in F1.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_khare_crisis_information_relevancy/,"Social media platforms have become key portals for sharing and consuming information during crisis situations. However, humanitarian organisations and effected communities often struggle to sieve through the large volumes of data that are typically shared on such platforms during crises to determine which posts are truly relevant to the crisis, and which are not. Previous work on automatically classifying crisis information was mostly focused on using statistical features. However, such approaches tend to be inappropriate when processing data on a type of crisis that the model was not trained on, such as processing information about a train crash, whereas the classifier was trained on floods, earthquakes, and typhoons. In such cases, the model will need to be retrained, which is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we explore the impact of semantics in classifying Twitter posts across same, and different, types of crises. We experiment with 26 crisis events, using a hybrid system that combines statistical features with various semantic features extracted from external knowledge bases. We show that adding semantic features has no noticeable benefit over statistical features when classifying same-type crises, whereas it enhances the classifier performance by up to 7.2\% when classifying information about a new type of crisis."

http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_gentile_ontology_population/,"Ontologies are a basic tool to formalize and share knowledge. However, very often the conceptualization of a specific domain depends on the particular user’s needs. We propose a methodology to perform user-centric ontology population that efficiently includes human-in-the-loop at each step. Given the existence of suitable target ontologies, our methodology supports the alignment of concepts in the user’s conceptualization with concepts of the target ontologies, using a novel hierarchical classification approach. Our methodology also helps the user to build, alter and grow their initial conceptualization, exploiting both the target ontologies and new facts extracted from unstructured data. We evaluate our approach on a real-world example in the healthcare domain, in which adverse phrases for drug reactions, as extracted from user blogs, are aligned with MedDRA concepts. The evaluation shows that our approach has high efficacy in assisting the user to both build the initial ontology (HITS@10 up to 99.5%) and to maintain it (HITS@10 up to 99.1%)."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_abdel_qader_vocabulary_terms/,"Vocabularies are used for modeling data in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) like the Linked Open Data Cloud and Wikidata. During their lifetime, vocabularies are subject to changes. New terms are coined, while existing terms are modified or deprecated. We first quantify the amount and frequency of changes in vocabularies. Subsequently, we investigate to which extend and when the changes are adopted in the evolution of KGs. We conduct our experiments on three large-scale KGs for which time-stamped information is available, namely the Billion Triples Challenge datasets, Dynamic Linked Data Observatory dataset, and Wikidata. Our results show that the change frequency of terms is rather low, but can have high impact due to the large amount of distributed graph data on the web. Furthermore, not all coined terms are used and most of the deprecated terms are still used by data publishers. The adoption time of terms coming from different vocabularies ranges from very fast (few days) to very slow (few years). Surprisingly, we could observe some adoptions before the vocabulary changes were published. Understanding the evolution of vocabulary terms is important to avoid wrong assumptions about the modeling status of data published on the web, which may result in difficulties when querying the data from distributed sources."

This paper takes a broader view and looks at the entire life cycle of the collaborative process to gain insights into how new functionality is proposed and accepted, and how contributors engage with one another. The analysis resulted in several findings. First, the collaborative ontology engineering roles identified in previous studies with a much stronger link to ontology editors apply to community interaction contexts as well. In the same time, the participation inequality is less pronounced than the 90-9-1 rule for Internet communities. In addition, schema.org seems to facilitate a form of collaboration that is friendly towards newcomers, whose concerns receive as much attention from the community as those of their longer-serving peers."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_minier_triple_pattern/,"Following the Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) approach, intelligent clients are able to improve the availability of the Linked Data. However, data availability is still limited by the availability of TPF servers. Although some existing TPF servers belonging to different organizations already replicate the same datasets, existing intelligent clients are not able to take advantage of replicated data to provide fault tolerance and load-balancing. In this paper, we propose Ulysses, an intelligent TPF client that takes advantage of replicated datasets to provide fault tolerance and load-balancing. By reducing the load on a server, Ulysses improves the overall Linked Data availability and reduces data hosting cost for organizations. Ulysses relies on an adaptive client-side load-balancer and a cost-model to distribute the load among heterogeneous replicated TPF servers. Experimentations demonstrate that Ulysses reduces the load of TPF servers, tolerates failures and improves queries execution time in case of heavy loads on servers."

Moreover, it has been shown that around 90% of the information published as Linked Open Data is available as data dumps and 84% of endpoints are offline. To this end, we propose a Web service called Where is my URI?. Our service aims at indexing URIs and their use in order to let Linked Data consumers find the respective RDF data source, in case such information cannot be retrieved from the URI alone. We rank the corresponding datasets by following the rationale upon which a dataset contributes to the definition of a URI proportionally to the number of literals.

The Stream Reasoning (SR) domain aims to combine the performance of stream/event processing and the reasoning expressiveness of knowledge representation systems by adopting Semantic Web standards to represent streaming elements. In this paper, we argue that the mainstream SR model is not flexible enough to properly express the temporal relations common in many applications. We show that the model can miss relevant information and lead to inconsistent derivations. Moving from these premises, we introduce a novel SR model that provides expressive ontological and temporal reasoning by neatly decoupling their scope to avoid information loss and inconsistency. We implement the model in the DOTR system that defines ontological reasoning using Datalog and temporal reasoning using the TESLA Complex Event Processing language, which builds on metric temporal logic. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our model through various examples and benchmarks. We also show that DOTR outperforms state-of-the-art SR tools."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_van_woensel_semantic_reasoning/,"Mobile hardware improvements have opened the door for deploying rule systems on ubiquitous, mobile platforms. By executing rule-based tasks locally, less re-mote (cloud) resources are needed, bandwidth usage is reduced, and local, time-sensitive tasks are no longer influenced by network conditions. Further, with data being increasingly published in semantic format, an opportunity arises for rule systems to leverage the embedded semantics of semantic, ontology-based data. To support this kind of ontology-based reasoning in rule systems, rule-based axiomatizations of ontology semantics can be utilized (e.g., OWL 2 RL). Nonetheless, recent benchmarks have found that any kind of ontology-based reasoning on mobile platforms still lacks scalability, at least when directly re-using existing (PC- or server-based) technologies. To create a tailored solution for resource-constrained platforms, we propose changes to RETE, the mainstay algorithm for production rule systems. In particular, we present an adapted algorithm that, by selectively pooling RETE memories, aims to better balance memory usage with performance. Further, we show that this algorithm is well-suited towards many typical Semantic Web scenarios. Using our custom algorithm, we perform an extensive evaluation of semantic reasoning both on the PC and mobile platform."

A typical exchange between Web of Things agents involves small pieces of semantically described data (RDF data sets of less than hundred triples). In this context, we show how JSON-LD, serialized in binary JSON formats like EXI4JSON and CBOR, outperforms the state-of-the-art. Our experiments were performed on data sets provided by the literature, as well as a production data set exported from Siemens Desigo CC.

The features facilitate the discovery of interesting and valuable facts in (linked) data which were not initially sought for. In this work, we present an implementation of those features called FERASAT. FERASAT provides an adaptive multigraph-based faceted browsing interface to catalyze serendipity while browsing Linked Data. FERASAT is already in use within the domain of science, technology & innovation (STI) studies to allow researchers who are not familiar with Linked Data technologies to explore heterogeneous interlinked datasets in order to observe and interpret surprising facts from the data relevant to policy and innovation studies.

We introduce two algorithms, answers partitioning and lazy join, that together significantly improve the efficiency of query relaxation.

Moreover, the relaxed descriptions provide explanations for their semantic similarity."

We focus on an important support for such summaries: ArticlePlaceholders, which are dynamically generated content pages in underserved Wikipedia versions. They enable native speakers to access existing information in Wikidata, a structured Knowledge Base (KB). To extend those ArticlePlaceholders, we provide a system, which processes the triples of the KB as they are provided by the ArticlePlaceholder, and generate a comprehensible textual summary. This data-driven approach is employed with the goal of understanding how well it matches the communities’ needs on two underserved languages on the Web: Arabic, a language with a big community with disproportionate access to knowledge online, and Esperanto, an easily-acquainted, artificial language whose Wikipedia content is maintained by a small but devoted community. With the help of the Arabic and Esperanto Wikipedians, we conduct a study which evaluates not only the quality of the generated text, but also the usefulness of our end-system to any underserved Wikipedia version."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_fetahu_multiple_models/,"Entity aspect recommendation is an emerging task in semantic search that help users discover serendipitous and prominent information with respect to an entity, of which salience (e.g., popularity) is the only important factor in previous work. However, entity aspects are temporally dynamic and often driven by happening events. For such cases, aspect suggestion based solely on salience features can give unsatisfactory results, for two reasons. First, salience is often accumulated over a long time period and does not account for recency. Second, an aspect that is related to an event entity is often strongly time-dependent. In this paper, we study the task of temporal aspect recommendation for a given entity, which aims at recommending the most relevant aspects and takes into account aforementioned challenges in order to improve search experience. We propose a novel event-centric ensemble ranking method that learns from multiple time and type-dependent models and dynamically trades-off between the salience and recency characteristics of entity aspects.

We introduce and release CC-DBP, a web-scale dataset for training and benchmarking KBP systems. The dataset is based on Common Crawl as the corpus and DBpedia as the target knowledge base. Critically, by releasing the tools to build the dataset, we enable the dataset to remain current as new crawls and DBpedia dumps are released.

We investigate how and to what extent exploratory search can be supported on EKGs of architectural knowledge. We propose an approach for building exploratory search systems on EKGs and demonstrate its use within Siemens, which resulted in the STAR system used in practice by cca. 300 software architects. We found that the the EKG’s ontology allows making previously implicit organisational knowledge explicit and this knowledge informs the design of suitable relatedness metrics to support exploration. Yet, the performance of these metrics heavily depends on the characteristics of the EKG’s data. Therefore both statistical and user-based evaluations can be used to select the right metric before system implementation."

http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_calvanese_canonical_IRIs/,"In this paper, we study how to efficiently integrate multiple relational databases using an ontology-based approach. In ontology-based data integration (OBDI) an ontology provides a coherent view of multiple databases, and SPARQL queries over the ontology are rewritten into (federated) SQL queries over the underlying databases. Specifically, we address the scenario where records with different identifiers in different databases can represent the same entity. The standard approach in this case is to use sameAs to model the equivalence between entities. However, the standard semantics of sameAs may cause an exponential blow up of query results since all possible combinations of equivalent identifiers have to be included in the answers. The large number of answers is not only detrimental to the performance of query evaluation, but also makes the answers difficult to understand due to the redundancy they introduce. This motivates us to propose an alternative approach, which is based on assigning canonical IRIs to entities in order to avoid redundancy. Formally, we present our approach as a new SPARQL entailment regime and compare it with the sameAs approach. We provide a prototype implementation and evaluate it in two experiments: in a real-world data integration scenario in Statoil and in an experiment extending the Wisconsin benchmark. The experimental results show that the canonical IRI approach is significantly more scalable."

In this direction, one of the main open issues in using LD to feed a recommendation engine is related to feature selection: how to select only the most relevant subset of the original LD dataset thus avoiding both useless processing of data and the so called “course of dimensionality” problem. In this paper we show how ontology-based (linked) data summarization can drive the selection of properties/features useful to a recommender system. In particular, we compare a fully automated feature selection method based on ontology-based data summaries with more classical ones and we evaluate the performance of these methods in terms of accuracy and aggregate diversity of a recommender system exploiting the top-k selected features. We set up an experimental testbed relying on datasets related to different knowledge domains.

We therefore propose SQG, a SPARQL Query Generator with modular architecture, enabling easy integration with other components for the construction of a fully functional QA pipeline. SQG can be used on large open-domain KBs and handle noisy inputs by discovering a minimal subgraph based on uncertain inputs, that it receives from the NED and RE components.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2018_leme_empirical_analysis/,"Currently available datasets still have a large unexplored potential for interlinking. Ranking techniques contribute to this task by scoring datasets according to the likelihood of finding entities related to those of a target dataset. Ranked datasets can be either manually selected for standalone linking discovery tasks or automatically inspected by programs that would go through the ranking looking for entity links. In the first case, users typically choose datasets that seem more appropriate among those at the top of the ranking, having little tendency for an exhaustive selection over the entire ranking. On the other hand, automated processes would scan all datasets along a whole slice of the top of the ranking. Metrics such as nDCG better capture the degree of adherence of rankings to users expectations of finding the most relevant datasets at the very top of the ranking. Automatic processes, on the contrary, would benefit most from rankings that would have greater recall of datasets with related entities throughout the entire slice traversed. In this case, the Recall at Position k would better discriminate ranking models. This work presents empirical comparisons between different ranking models and argues that different algorithms could be used depending on whether the ranking is manually or automatically handled and, also, depending on the available metadata of the datasets. Experiments indicate that ranking algorithms that performed best with nDCG do not always have the best Recall at Position k, for high recall levels. Under the automatic perspective, the best algorithms may find the same number of datasets with related entities by inspecting a slice of the rank at least 40\% smaller. Under the manual perspective, the best algorithms may increase nDCG by 5-20\%, depending on the set of features."

http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_crosbie_financial_markets/,"The most successful hedge-funds in today’s financial markets are consuming large amounts of alternative data, including satellite imagery, point-of-sale data, news, social media and publications from the web. This new trend is driven by the fact that traditional factors have become less predictive in recent years, requiring sophisticated investors to explore new data sources. The majority of this new alternative content is unstructured and hence must first be converted into structured analytics data in order to be used systematically. Instead of building such capabilities themselves, financial firms are turning towards companies that specialize in this field. In this talk, Kevin will discuss some of the practical challenges of giving structure to unstructured content, how entities and ontologies may be used to link data and the ways in which semantic intelligence can be derived for use in financial trading algorithms."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_sheridan_digital_archives/,"What will people in the future know of today? As the homes for our collective memory archives have a special role to play. Semantic Web technologies address some important needs for digital archives and are being ever more embraced by the archival community. Archives face a big challenge. The use of digital technologies has profoundly shaped what types of record are created, captured, shared and made available. Digital records are not just documents or email but all sorts of content such as websites, threaded discussions, video, websites, structured datasets and even computer code. Yet, in the digital era, when so much is encoded as 0s and 1s there is no long term solution to the challenge of preservation. All archives can do is make the institutional commitment to continue to invest, through generations of technological change, in the engineering effort required for records to continue to be available. The National Archives is one of the world’s leading digital archives. Our Digital Records Infrastructure, which makes extensive use of RDF and SPARQL, is capable of safely, securely and actively preserving large quantities of data. Our Web Archive provides a comprehensive record of government on the web. We also lead the maintenance of a register of file format signatures that is used relied on by archives and other memory institutions around the world. As a digital archive we provide value by preserving digital records, keeping them safe for the future. We maintain the context for the records so their evidential value can be understood in the context of their creation and continuing use. We produce records so that they are available for others to access, and we also enable use. Semantic Web technologies play a key role in each of these areas and are integral to our approach for preserving, contextualising, presenting and enable use of digital records. This presentation will explain why and how we have used semantic web technologies for digital archiving and the benefits we have seen, for managing heterogeneous metadata and also in areas such a provenance and trust. It will explore new opportunities for archives from using Semantic Web technologies in particular around contextual description, with digital records increasingly contextualising each other. This is part of a shift to a more fluid approach where context grows with an archives collection and in relation to other collections. Finally it will also look at the challenges for archives with using Semantic Web technologies in particular around how best to manage uncertainty in our data as we increasingly use probabilistic approaches"
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_aroyo_comfort_zone/,"Ambiguity in interpreting signs is not a new idea, yet the vast majority of research in machine interpretation of signals such as speech, language, images, video, audio, etc., tend to ignore ambiguity. This is evidenced by the fact that metrics for quality of machine understanding rely on a ground truth, in which each instance (a sentence, a photo, a sound clip, etc) is assigned a discrete label, or set of labels, and the machine’s prediction for that instance is compared to the label to determine if it is correct. This determination yields the familiar precision, recall, accuracy, and f-measure metrics, but clearly presupposes that this determination can be made. CrowdTruth is a form of collective intelligence based on a vector representation that accommodates diverse interpretation perspectives and encourages human annotators to disagree with each other, in order to expose latent elements such as ambiguity and worker quality. In other words, CrowdTruth assumes that when annotators disagree on how to label an example, it is because the example is ambiguous, the worker isn’t doing the right thing, or the task itself is not clear. In previous work on CrowdTruth, the focus was on how the disagreement signals from low quality workers and from unclear tasks can be isolated. Recently, we observed that disagreement can also signal ambiguity. The basic hypothesis is that, if workers disagree on the correct label for an example, then it will be more diﬃcult for a machine to classify that example. The elaborate data analysis to determine if the source of the disagreement is ambiguity supports our intuition that low clarity signals ambiguity, while high clarity sentences quite obviously express one or more of the target relations. In this talk I will share the experiences and lessons learned on the path to understanding diversity in human interpretation and the ways to capture it as ground truth to enable machines to deal with such diversity."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_roeder_entity_linking/,"The evaluation of Named Entity Recognition as well as Entity Linking systems is mostly based on manually created gold standards. However, the current gold standards have three main drawbacks. First, they do not share a common set of rules pertaining to what is to be marked and linked as an entity. Moreover, most of the gold standards have not been checked by other researchers after they were published. Hence, they commonly contain mistakes. Finally, many gold standards lack actuality as in most cases the reference knowledge bases used to link entities are refined over time while the gold standards are typically not updated to the newest version of the reference knowledge base. In this work, we analyze existing gold standards and derive a set of rules for annotating documents for named entity recognition and entity linking. We derive Eaglet, a tool that supports the semi-automatic checking of a gold standard based on these rules. A manual evaluation of Eaglet’s results shows that it achieves an accuracy of up to 88% when detecting errors. We apply Eaglet to 13 English gold standards and detect 38,453 errors. An evaluation of 10 tools on a subset of these datasets shows a performance difference of up to 10% micro F-measure on average."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_inel_harnessing_diversity/,"Over the last years, information extraction tools have gained a great popularity and brought significant performance improvement in extracting meaning from structured or unstructured data. For example, named entity recognition (NER) tools identify types such as people, organizations or places in text. However, despite their high F1 performance, NER tools are still prone to brittleness due to their highly specialized and constrained input and training data. Thus, each tool is able to extract only a subset of the named entities (NE) mentioned in a given text. In order to improve NE Coverage, we propose a hybrid approach, where we first aggregate the output of various NER tools and then validate and extend it through crowdsourcing. The results from our experiments show that this approach performs significantly better than the individual state-of-the-art tools (including existing tools that integrate individual outputs already). Furthermore, we show that the crowd is quite effective in (1) identifying mistakes, inconsistencies and ambiguities in currently used ground truth, as well as in (2) a promising approach to gather ground truth annotations for NER that capture a multitude of opinions."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_tran_entity_recommendation/,"Entities and their relatedness are useful information in various tasks such as entity disambiguation, entity recommendation or search. In many cases, entity relatedness is highly affected by dynamic contexts, which can be reflected in the outcome of different applications. However, the role of context is largely unexplored in existing entity relatedness measures. In this paper, we introduce the notion of contextual entity relatedness, and show its usefulness in the new yet important problem of context-aware entity recommendation. We propose a novel method of computing the contextual relatedness with integrated time and topic models. By exploiting an entity graph and enriching it with an entity embedding method, we show that our proposed relatedness can effectively recommend entities, taking contexts into account. We conduct large-scale experiments on a real-world data set, and the results show considerable improvements of our solution over the states of the art."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_zhang_entity_deduplication/,"ScholarlyData is the new and currently the largest reference linked dataset of the Semantic Web community about papers, people, organisations, and events related to its academic conferences. Originally started from the Semantic Web Dog Food (SWDF), it addressed multiple issues on data representation and maintenance by (i) adopting a novel data model and (ii) establishing an open source workflow to support the addition of new data from the community. Nevertheless, the major issue with the current dataset is the presence of multiple URIs for the same entities, typically in persons and organisations. In this work we: (i) perform entity deduplication on the whole dataset, using supervised classification methods; (ii) devise a protocol to choose the most representative URI for an entity and deprecate duplicated ones, while ensuring backward compatibilities for them; (iii) incorporate the automatic deduplication step in the general workflow to reduce the creation of duplicate URIs when adding new data. Our early experiment focused on the person and organisation URIs and results show significant improvement over state-of-the-art solutions. We managed to consolidate, on the entire dataset, over 100 and 800 pairs of duplicate person and organisation URIs and their associated triples (over 1,800 and 5,000) respectively, hence significantly improving the overall quality and connectivity of the data graph. Integrated into the ScholarlyData data publishing workflow, we believe that this serves a major step towards the creation of clean, high-quality scholarly linked data on the Semantic Web."

In this paper, we present a framework for the intrinsic evaluation of RDF links, based on core principles of Web data integration and foundations of Information Retrieval. We measure the extent to which links facilitate the discovery of an extended description of entities, and the discovery of other entities in other data sets. We also measure the use of different vocabularies. We analysed links extracted from a set of data sets from the Linked Data Crawl 2014 using these measures."

An important challenge when aiming to update these links automatically under the open-world assumption is the fact that usually only positive examples for the links exist. We address this challenge by presenting and evaluating Wombat, a novel approach for the discovery of links between knowledge bases that relies exclusively on positive examples. Wombat is based on generalisation via an upward refinement operator to traverse the space of link specification. We study the theoretical characteristics of Wombat and evaluate it on 8 different benchmark datasets. Our evaluation suggests that Wombat outperforms state-of-the-art supervised approaches while relying on less information. Moreover, our evaluation suggests that Wombat’s pruning algorithm allows it to scale well even on large datasets."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_koutraki_linked_datasets/,"The large number of linked datasets in the Web, and their diversity in terms of schema representation has led to a fragmented dataset landscape. Querying and addressing information needs that span across disparate datasets requires the alignment of such schemas. Majority of schema and ontology alignment approaches focus exclusively on class alignment. Yet, relation alignment has not been fully addressed, and existing approaches fall short on addressing the dynamics of datasets and their size. In this work, we address the problem of relation alignment across disparate linked datasets. Our approach focuses on two main aspects. First, online relation alignment, where we do not require full access, and sample instead for a minimal subset of the data. Thus, we address the main limitation of existing work on dealing with the large scale of linked datasets, and in cases where the datasets provide only query access. Second, we learn supervised machine learning models for which we employ various features or matchers that account for the diversity of linked datasets at the instance level. We perform an experimental evaluation on real-world linked datasets, DBpedia, YAGO, and Freebase. The results show superior performance against state-of-the-art approaches in schema matching, with an average relation alignment accuracy of 84%. In addition, we show that relation alignment can be performed efficiently at scale."

In this paper, we propose a synthesis model for the generation of benchmark datasets for those tasks. Synthesizing data is a way of having control over important characteristics of the data, and allows the study of the impact of such characteristics on the performance of different methods. The proposed model uses existing knowledge graphs to create synthetic graphs with similar characteristics, such as distributions of classes, relations, and instances. As a first step, we replicate already existing knowledge graphs in order to validate the synthesis model. To do so, we perform extensive experiments with different link and type prediction methods. We show that we can systematically create knowledge graph benchmarks which allow for quantitative measurements of the result quality and scalability of link and type prediction methods."

Automatic identification of pro-ISIS users on social media has, thus, become the centre of interest for various governmental and research organisations. In this paper we propose a semantic graph-based approach for radicalisation detection on Twitter. Unlike previous works, which mainly rely on the lexical representation of the content published by Twitter users, our approach extracts and makes use of the underlying semantics of words exhibited by these users to identify their pro/anti-ISIS stances. Our results show that classifiers trained from semantic features outperform those trained from lexical, sentiment, topic and network features by 7.8% on average F1-measure."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_lu_crowdsourced_affinity/,"User-entity affinity is an essential component of many user-centric information systems such as online advertising, exploratory search, recommender system etc. The affinity is often assessed by analysing the interactions between users and entities within a data space. Among different affinity assessment techniques, content-based ones hypothesize that users have higher affinity with entities similar to the ones with which they had positive interactions in the past. Knowledge graph and folksonomy are respectively the milestones of Semantic Web and Social Web. Despite their shared crowdsourcing trait (not necessarily all knowledge graphs but some major large-scale ones), the encoded data are different in nature and structure. Knowledge graph encodes factual data with a formal ontology. Folksonomy encodes experience data with a loose structure. Many efforts have been made to make sense of folksonomy and to structure the community knowledge inside. Both data spaces allow to compute similarity between entities which can thereafter be used to calculate user-entity affinity. In this paper, we are interested in observing their comparative performance in the affinity assessment task. To this end, we carried out a first experiment within a travel destination recommendation scenario on a gold standard dataset. Our main findings are that knowledge graph helps to assess more accurately the affinity but folksonomy helps to increase the diversity and the novelty. This interesting complementarity motivated us to develop a semantic affinity framework to harvest the benefits of both data spaces. A second experiment with real users showed the utility of the proposed framework and confirmed our findings."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_capadisli_linked_data/,"In this article we describe the Linked Data Notifications (LDN) protocol, which is a W3C Candidate Recommendation. Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, for example, by social applications. The information contained within a notification is structured arbitrarily, and typically only usable by the application which generated it in the first place. In the spirit of Linked Data, we propose that notifications should be reusable by multiple authorised applications. Through separating the concepts of senders, receivers and consumers of notifications, and leveraging Linked Data principles of shared vocabularies and URIs, LDN provides a building block for decentralised Web applications. This permits end users more freedom to switch between the online tools they use, as well as generating greater value when notifications from different sources can be used in combination. We situate LDN alongside related initiatives, and discuss additional considerations such as security and abuse prevention measures. We evaluate the protocol’s effectiveness by analysing multiple, independent implementations, which pass a suite of formal tests and can be demonstrated interoperating with each other.

Nomothesia offers advanced services for retrieving and querying Greek legislation and is intended for citizens through intuitive presentational views and search interfaces, but also for application developers that would like to consume content through two web services: a SPARQL endpoint and a RESTful API.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_moreno_entity_linking/,"The correct identification of the link between an entity mention in a text and a known entity in a large knowledge base is important in information retrieval or information extraction.

This paper proposes a novel method for the second step which is based on the joint learning of embeddings for the words in the text and the entities in the knowledge base. By learning these embeddings in the same space we arrive at a more conceptually grounded model that can be used for candidate selection based on the surrounding context. The relative improvement of this approach is experimentally validated on a recent benchmark corpus from the TAC-EDL 2015 evaluation campaign."

To effectively capitalise on the experience gained in the creation and adoption of such pipelines, the need arises for mechanisms able to capture knowledge about datasets of interest, data processing methods designed to achieve a given goal, and the performance achieved when applying such methods to the considered datasets. However, due to its distributed and often unstructured nature, this knowledge is not easily accessible. In this paper, we use (scientific) publications as source of knowledge about Data Processing Pipelines. We describe a method designed to classify sentences according to the nature of the contained information (i.e. scientific objective, dataset, method, software, result), and to extract relevant named entities. The extracted information is then semantically annotated and published as linked data in open knowledge repositories according to the DMS ontology for data processing metadata. To demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of our approach, we present the results of a quantitative and qualitative analysis performed on four different conference series."

Applications for the contextual exploration of KGs help users explore information extracted from a KG, including SAs, while they are reading an input text. Because of the large number of SAs that can be extracted from a text, a first challenge in these applications is to effectively determine which SAs are most interesting to the users, defining a suitable ranking function over SAs. However, since different users may have different interests, an additional challenge is to personalize this ranking function to match individual users’ preferences. In this paper we introduce a novel active learning to rank model to let a user rate small samples of SAs, which are used to iteratively learn a personalized ranking function. Experiments conducted with two data sets show that the approach is able to improve the quality of the ranking function with a limited number of user interactions."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_tresp_declarative_memories/,"The major components of the brain’s declarative or explicit memory are semantic memory and episodic memory. Whereas semantic memory stores general factual knowledge, episodic memory stores events together with their temporal and spatial contexts. We present mathematical models for declarative memories where we consider semantic memory to be represented by triples and episodes to be represented as quadruples i.e., triples in time. E.g., (Jack, receivedDiagnosis, Diabetes, Jan1) states that Jack was diagnosed with diabetes on January 1. Both from a cognitive and a technical perspective, an interesting research question is how declarative data can efficiently be stored and semantically be decoded. We propose that a suitable data representation for episodic event data is a 4-way tensor with dimensions subject, predicate, object, and time. We demonstrate that the 4-way tensor can be decomposed, e.g., using a 4-way Tucker model, which permits semantic decoding of an event, as well as efficient storage. We also propose that semantic memory can be derived from the episodic model by a marginalization of the time dimension, which can be performed efficiently. We argue that the storage of episodic memory typically requires models with a high rank, whereas semantic memory can be modelled with a comparably lower rank. We analyse experimentally the relationship between episodic and semantic memory models and discuss potential relationships to the corresponding brain’s cognitive memories."

For the purpose, we propose a machine learning solution that combines (unsupervised) distance-based clustering and the divide-and-conquer strategy.

While there is effort to convert data in RDF, the vast majority of data available on the Web does not conform to RDF. Indeed, exposing data in RDF, either natively or through wrappers, can be very costly. Furthermore, in the emerging Web of Things, resource constraints of devices prevent from processing RDF graphs. Hence one cannot expect that all the data on the Web be available as RDF anytime soon. Several tools can generate RDF from non-RDF data, and transformation or mapping languages have been designed to offer more flexible solutions (GRDDL, XSPARQL, R2RML, RML, CSVW, etc.). In this paper, we introduce a new language, SPARQL-Generate, that generates RDF from: (i) a RDF Dataset, and (ii) a set of documents in arbitrary formats. As SPARQL-Generate is designed as an extension of SPARQL 1.1, it can provably: (i) be implemented on top on any existing SPARQL engine, and (ii) leverage the SPARQL extension mechanism to deal with an open set of formats. Furthermore, we show evidence that (iii) it can be easily learned by knowledge engineers that know SPARQL 1.1, and (iv) our first naive open source implementation performs better than the reference implementation of RML for big transformations.

In particular, little attention has been paid to the benefits that the semantic infrastructure can bring to maintain the wiki content, for instance to ensure that the effects of a wiki edit are consistent across infoboxes. In this paper, we present an approach to allow ontology-based updates of wiki content. Starting from DBpedia-like mappings converting infoboxes to a fragment of OWL 2 RL ontology, we discuss various issues associated with translating SPARQL updates on top of semantic data to the underlying Wiki content.

In this paper, we present ROWLTab, together with a user evaluation of its effectiveness compared to entering axioms using the standard Protégé interface.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_sfar_AGACY_monitoring/,"Acquiring an ongoing human activity from raw sensor data is a challenging problem in pervasive systems. Earlier, research in this field has mainly adopted data-driven or knowledge based techniques for the activity recognition, however these techniques suffer from a number of drawbacks. Therefore, recent works have proposed a combination of these techniques. Nevertheless, they still do not handle sensor data uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid model called AGACY Monitoring to cope with the uncertain nature of the sensor data. Moreover, we present a new algorithm to infer the activity instances by exploiting the obtained uncertainty values. The experimental evaluation of AGACY Monitoring with a large real-world dataset has proved the viability and efficiency of our solution."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_schneider_mobility_streams/,"The development of (semi)-autonomous vehicles and communication between vehicles and infrastructure (V2X) will aid to improve road safety by identifying dangerous traffic scenes. A key to this is the Local Dynamic Map (LDM), which acts as an integration platform for static, semi-static, and dynamic information about traffic in a geographical context. At present, the LDM approach is purely database-oriented with simple query capabilities, while an elaborate domain model as captured by an ontology and queries over data streams that allow for semantic concepts and spatial relationships are still missing. To fill this gap, we present an approach in the context of ontology-mediated query answering that features conjunctive queries over DL-Lite AA  ontologies allowing spatial relations and window operators over streams having a pulse. For query evaluation, we present a rewriting approach to ordinary DL-Lite AA that transforms spatial relations involving epistemic aggregate queries and uses a decomposition approach that generates a query execution plan. Finally, we report on experiments with two scenarios and evaluate our implementation based on the stream RDBMS PipelineDB."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_le_van_stream_processing_queries/,"With the growing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and sensing technologies, a large number of data streams are being generated at a very rapid pace. To explore the potentials of the integration of IoT and semantic technologies, a few RDF Stream Processing (RSP) query engines are made available which are capable of processing, analyzing and reasoning over semantic data streams in real-time. This way, RSP mitigates data interoperability issues and promotes knowledge discovery and smart decision making for time-sensitive applications. However, a major hurdle in the wide adoption of RSP systems is their query performance. Particularly, the ability of RSP engines to handle a large number of concurrent queries is very limited which refrains large scale stream processing applications (e.g. smart city applications) to adopt RSP. In this paper, we propose a shared-join based approach to improve the performance of an RSP engine for concurrent queries. We also leverage query federation mechanisms to allow distributed query processing over multiple RSP engine instances in order to gain performance for concurrent and distributed queries. We apply load balancing strategies to distribute queries and further optimize the concurrent query performance. We provide a proof of concept implementation by extending CQELS RSP engine and evaluate our approach using existing benchmark datasets for RSP. We also compare the performance of our proposed approach with the state of the art implementation of CQELS RSP engine."

By nature, human movement consists of complex combinations of spatiotemporal events, a fact that creates a big challenge for representing, searching, and reasoning about movement-related content, such as movement annotations on video dances. We have defined MoveOnto, a movement ontology whose expressive power captures movements that range from body states and transitions based on the semantics of Labanotation, to generic actions or specialized vocabularies of specific dance genres, e.g., ballet or folk. We combine the ontology description with temporal reasoning in Datalog-MTL, based on temporal rules of the movement events. Finally, we present the specifications and requirements for dance exploration from a user’s perspective and describe the architecture of BalOnSe, a specific system that is currently under implementation on top of MoveOnto according to them. BalOnSe consists of a web-based application with semantic annotation, search, and browsing on the movements, as well as a backend with archival and query processing functionality based on temporal rules."

http://videolectures.net/eswc2017_hildebrandt_engineering_knowledge/,"The development and operation of highly flexible automated systems for discrete manufacturing, which can quickly adapt to changing products, has become a major research field in industrial automation. Adapting a manufacturing system to a new product for instance requires comparing the systems functionality against the requirements imposed by the changed product. With an increasing frequency of product changes, this comparison should be automated. Unfortunately, there is no standard way to model the functionality of a manufacturing system, which is an obstacle to automation. The engineer still has to analyze all documents provided by engineering tools like 3D-CAD data, electrical CAD data or controller code. In order to support this time consuming process, it is necessary to model the so-called skills of a manufacturing system. A skill represents certain features an engineer has to check during the adaption of a manufacturing system, e.g. the kinematic of an assembly or the maximum load for a gripper. Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) provide a feasible solution for modeling and reasoning on the knowledge of these features. This paper provides the results of a project that focused on modeling the kinematic skills of assemblies. The overall approach as well as further requirements are shown. Since not all expectations on reasoning functionality could be met by available reasoners, the paper focuses on desired reasoning features that would support the further use of SWT in the engineering domain."

Low latency is attained by compressing the scheme and data of processed streams with a dedicated semantic-aware encoding solution.

This paper presents the results of the survey, provides an overview of the smartAPI specification and a reference implementation, and discusses use cases of smartAPI. We show that annotating APIs with smartAPI metadata is straightforward through an extension of the existing Swagger editor.

At the same time, Airbus maintains a dataset of programmed maintenance task (MPD) for each family of aircraft. Currently, OIs are reported by companies in Excel spreadsheets and experts have to find manually in the OIs the ones that are most likely to match an existing task. In this paper, we describe a semi-automatic approach using semantic technologies to assist the experts of the domain to improve the matching process of OIs with related MPD.

In this paper we present ArmaTweet, an extension of SMA developed in a collaboration between armasuisse and the Universities of Fribourg and Oxford that supports semantic event detection. Our system extracts a structured representation from the tweets’ text using NLP technology, which it then integrates with DBpedia and WordNet in an RDF knowledge graph.

Since complex data transformations remain out of scope for mapping languages, these steps are often implemented as custom solutions, or with systems separate from the mapping process. The former data transformations remain case-specific, often coupled with the mapping, whereas the latter are not reusable across systems. In this paper, we propose an approach where data transformations (i) are defined declaratively and (ii) are aligned with the mapping languages. We employ an alignment of data transformations described using the Function Ontology () and mapping of data to Linked Data described using the rdf Mapping Language (rml). We validate that our approach can map and transform dbpedia in a declaratively defined and aligned way. Our approach is not case-specific: data transformations are independent of their implementation and thus interoperable, while the functions are decoupled and reusable. This allows developers to improve the generation framework, whilst contributors can focus on the actual Linked Data, as there are no more dependencies, neither between the transformations and the generation framework nor their implementations."

Although the Linked Data infrastructure could potentially be used to selectively share RDF data with different individuals or organisations, the primary focus remains on the unrestricted sharing of public data.

At the most basic level both access control and encryption mechanisms are required. In this paper, we propose a flexible and dynamic mechanism for securely storing and efficiently querying RDF datasets.

In our approach we extended the classic bipartite data model, in which only user-item connections are modeled, by injecting the exogenous knowledge about the items which is available in the LOD cloud. Our approach works in two steps: first, all the available items are automatically mapped to a DBpedia node; next, the resources gathered from DBpedia that describe the item are connected to the item nodes, thus enriching the original representation and giving rise to a tripartite data model. Such a data model can be exploited to provide users with recommendations by running PPR against the resulting representation and by suggesting the items with the highest PageRank score. In the experimental evaluation we showed that our semantics-aware recommendation framework exploiting DBpedia and PPR can overcome the performance of several state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, a proper tuning of PPR parameters, obtained by better distributing the weights among the nodes modeled in the graph, further improved the overall accuracy of the framework and confirmed the effectiveness of our strategy."

Central questions to summarization are: how to identify the most important nodes and then how to link them in order to produce a valid sub-schema graph. In this paper, we try to answer the first question by revisiting six well-known measures from graph theory and adapting them for RDF/S KBs. Then, we proceed further to model the problem of linking those nodes as a graph Steiner-Tree problem (GSTP) employing approximations and heuristics to speed up the execution of the respective algorithms. The performed experiments show the added value of our approach since (a) our adaptations outperform current state of the art measures for selecting the most important nodes and (b) the constructed summary has a better quality in terms of the additional nodes introduced to the generated summary."

It has become common for data analysts to have a mandate for computing Big Data  analytics without holding the rights to access the individual data points in the input, as they may contain sensitive information or personal data protected by privacy regulations. This talk discusses the idea that techniques used for semantic enrichment of Big Data (such as semantic lifting to harmonize metadata representation across data collection points and pre-joins at data ingestion time to avoid computing semantic joins on Big Data storage) can be seen as non-linear leakage and privacy risk boosters.   Intuition suggests that semantic techniques applied to  Big Data representation may have a double impact on security risks: (1) increase leakage risk by increasing the value for the attacker per unit of information leaked (2) increase intrusion risk, making injection attacks (i.e. attacks aimed at poisoning data for subverting the outcome of analytics) more effective per unit of poisoned information injected .    However, no clear methodology is currently available for quantifying the impact of these boosters. This talk will discuss a (semi-)quantitative technique for computing Big Data leakage risk estimates, in order to meaningfully compare them with the quantifiable benefits of semantic enrichment.

Thus, these approaches relax an RDF query without knowing its failure causes (FCs). In this paper, we study the idea of identifying these FCs to speed up the query relaxation process.

State-of-the-art techniques have focused on linking explicitly mentioned entities in tweets with reasonable success. However, we argue that in addition to explicit mentions – i.e. 'The movie Gravity was more expensive than the mars orbiter mission' – entities (movie Gravity) can also be mentioned implicitly – i.e. 'This new space movie is crazy. you must watch it!.' This paper introduces the problem of implicit entity linking in tweets. We propose an approach that models the entities by exploiting their factual and contextual knowledge. We demonstrate how to use these models to perform implicit entity linking on a ground truth dataset with 397 tweets from two domains, namely, Movie and Book. Specifically, we show: 1) the importance of linking implicit entities and its value addition to the standard entity linking task, and 2) the importance of exploiting contextual knowledge associated with an entity for linking their implicit mentions.

Researchers have proposed several metrics and have developed numerous tools to measure the qualities of the data sets in LOD from different dimensions. However, there exist few studies on evaluating data set quality from the users’ usability perspective and usability has great impacts on the spread and reuse of LOD data sets. On the other hand, usability is well studied in the area of software quality. In the newly published standard ISO/IEC 25010, usability is further broadened to include the notion of “quality in use” besides the other two factors, namely, internal and external. In this paper, we first adapt the notions and the methods used in software quality to assess the data set quality. Second, we formally define two quality dimensions, namely, Queriability and Informativity from the perspective of quality in use. The two proposed dimensions correspond to querying and answering, respectively, which are the most frequent usage scenarios for accessing LOD data sets. Then we provide a series of metrics to measure the two dimensions. Last, we apply the metrics to two representative data sets in LOD (i.e., YAGO and DBpedia). In the evaluating process, we select dozens of questions from both QALD and WebQuestions and ask a group of users to construct queries as well as to check the answers with the help of our usability testing tool.

There are two types of properties: object properties, and datatype properties. Type information can be made available for object properties as their object values are URIs. Typed object properties allow richer semantic analysis compared to datatype properties, whose object values are literals. In fact, many datatype properties can be analyzed to suggest types selected from a schema similar to object properties, enabling their wider use in applications. In this paper, we propose an approach to glean types for datatype properties by processing their object values.

To address this problem, this paper proposes to use linguistic frames as a common representation and maps heterogeneous knowledge bases to the FrameBase schema, which is formed by a large inventory of these frames. We develop several methods to create complex mappings from external knowledge bases to this schema, using text similarity measures, machine learning, and different heuristics.

The results show that using the SLP-feature improves the recommendation quality by 29–36 % considering the Mean Average Precision and the Mean Reciprocal Rank at the first five positions compared to recommendations based on solely the term’s popularity and whether it is from an already used vocabulary."

This paper proposes a new provenance model that borrows properties from both how and where provenance models, and is suitable for capturing the triple and attribute level provenance of data introduced via SPARQL INSERT updates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that deals with the provenance of SPARQL updates using algebraic expressions, in the spirit of the well-established model of provenance semirings. We present an algorithm that records the provenance of SPARQL update results, and a reconstruction algorithm that uses this provenance to identify a SPARQL update that is compatible to the original one, given only the recorded provenance. Our approach is implemented and evaluated on top of Virtuoso Database Engine."

Efficient and accurate private record linkage algorithms are necessary to achieve this. However, records are often linked based on personally identifiable information, and protecting the privacy of individuals is critical. This paper contributes to this field by studying an important component of the private record linkage problem: linking based on names while keeping those names encrypted, both on disk and in memory. We explore the applicability, accuracy and speed of three different primary approaches to this problem (along with several variations) and compare the results to common name-matching metrics on unprotected data.

This task is of particular interest when addressing issues such as entity retrieval, semantic search and data linking. Here, we focus on that last issue. We introduce a dataset recommendation approach to identify linking candidates based on the presence of schema overlap between datasets. While an understanding of the nature of the content of specific datasets is a crucial prerequisite, we adopt the notion of dataset profiles, where a dataset is characterized through a set of schema concept labels that best describe it and can be potentially enriched by retrieving their textual descriptions. We identify schema overlap by the help of a semantico-frequential concept similarity measure and a ranking criterium based on the tf*idf cosine similarity. The experiments , conducted over all available linked datasets on the Linked Open Data cloud, show that our method achieves an average precision of up to 53% for a recall of 100%. As an additional contribution, our method returns the mappings between the schema concepts across datasets – a particularly useful input for the data linking step."

In this work, we propose DoSeR (Disambiguation of Semantic Resources), a (named) entity disambiguation framework that is knowledge-base-agnostic in terms of RDF (e.g. DBpedia) and entity-annotated document knowledge bases (e.g. Wikipedia). Initially, our framework automatically generates semantic entity embeddings given one or multiple knowledge bases. In the following, DoSeR accepts documents with a given set of surface forms as input and collectively links them to an entity in a knowledge base with a graph-based approach. We evaluate DoSeR on seven different data sets against publicly available, state-of-the-art (named) entity disambiguation frameworks. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches that make use of RDF knowledge bases and/or entity-annotated document knowledge bases by up to 10 % F1 measure."

On four different datasets, we show that such learned models constantly achieve an accuracy above 95% at less than 2% of the runtime of a reasoner, using a decision tree with no more than 20 inner nodes.

NQS facilitates the identification of the desire (or expected output information) and the user-provided input information, and establishing their mutual semantic relationship.

Relevance is defined by a semantic query of the user, while novelty is ensured by checking whether the extracted statements are related, but non-existing in a knowledge base containing the currently known facts.

This paper presents an efficient semantic similarity approach exploiting explicit hierarchical and transversal relations.

Custom datatypes have reported use on the Web of Data, and show some advantages in representing some classical structures. Yet, their support by RDF processors is rare and implementation specific. In this paper, we first present the minimal set of functions that should be defined in order to make a custom datatype usable in query answering and reasoning. Based on this, we discuss solutions that would enable: (i) data publishers to publish the definition of arbitrary custom datatypes on the Web, and (ii) generic RDF processor or SPARQL query engine to discover custom datatypes on-the-fly, and to perform operations on them accordingly.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2016_polleres_handling_inconsistencies/,"The problem of updating ontologies has received increased attention in recent years. In the approaches proposed so far, either the update language is restricted to sets of ground atoms or, where the full SPARQL update language is allowed, the TBox language is restricted so that no inconsistencies can arise. In this paper we discuss directions to overcome these limitations. Starting from a DL-Lite fragment covering RDFS and concept disjointness axioms, we define three semantics for SPARQL instance-level (ABox) update: under cautious semantics, inconsistencies are resolved by rejecting updates potentially introducing conflicts; under brave semantics, instead, conflicts are overridden in favor of new information where possible; finally, the fainthearted semantics is a compromise between the former two approaches, designed to accommodate as much of the new information as possible, as long as consistency with the prior knowledge is not violated. We show how these semantics can be implemented in SPARQL via rewritings of polynomial size and draw first conclusions from their practical evaluation."

Unfortunately, modeling the specific contexts in which an identity relation holds is cumbersome and, due to arbitrary reuse and the Open World Assumption, it is impossible to anticipate all contexts in which an entity will be used. We propose an alternative semantics for owl:sameAs that partitions the original relation into a hierarchy of subrelations. The subrelation to which an identity statement belongs depends on the dataset in which the statement occurs. Adding future assertions may change the subrelation to which an identity statement belongs, resulting in a contextdependent and non-monotonic semantics. We show that this more fine-grained semantics is better able to characterize the actual use of owl:sameAs as observed in Linked Open Datasets."

The only thing we know about the concepts is their labels, i.e., we have no semantic information about these concepts. Moreover, their characteristics in the texts are incomplete. We propose an ontology-based approach, named Saupodoc, aiming to perform this particular annotation process by combining several approaches. Indeed, Saupodoc relies on a domain ontology relative to the field under study, which has a pivotal role, on its population with property assertions coming from documents and external resources, and its enrichment with formal specific concept definitions. Experiments have been carried out in two application domains, showing the benefit of the approach compared to well-known classifiers."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2016_both_qanary/,"It is very challenging to access the knowledge expressed within (big) data sets. Question answering (QA) aims at making sense out of data via a simpleto-use interface.

Therefore, it is cumbersome and inefficient to design and implement new or improved approaches, in particular as many components are not reusable. Hence, there is a strong need for enabling best-of-breed QA systems, where the best performing components are combined, aiming at the best quality achievable in the given domain. Taking into account the high variety of functionality that might be of use within a QA system and therefore reused in new QA systems, we provide an approach driven by a core QA vocabulary that is aligned to existing, powerful ontologies provided by domain-specific communities. We achieve this by a methodology for binding existing vocabularies to our core QA vocabulary without re-creating the information provided by external components. We thus provide a practical approach for rapidly establishing new (domain-specific) QA systems, while the core QA vocabulary is re-usable across multiple domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to open QA systems that is agnostic to implementation details and that inherently follows the linked data principles."

In this talk I will overview our recent work on probabilistic soft logic (PSL), an SRL framework for collective, probabilistic reasoning in relational domains. PSL is able to reason holistically about both entity attributes and relationships among the entities, along with ontological constraints. The underlying mathematical framework supports extremely efficient inference. Our recent results show that by building on state-of-the-art optimization methods in a distributed implementation, we can solve large-scale knowledge graph extraction problems with millions of random variables orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches."

http://videolectures.net/eswc2015_rettinger_semantic_representation/,"Learning cross-lingual semantic representations of relations from textual data is useful for tasks like cross-lingual information retrieval and question answering. So far, research has been mainly focused on cross-lingual entity linking, which is confined to linking between phrases in a text document and their corresponding entities in a knowledge base but cannot link to relations. In this paper, we present an approach for inducing clusters of semantically related relations expressed in text, where relation clusters (i) can be extracted from text of different languages, (ii) are embedded in a semantic representation of the context, and (iii) can be linked across languages to properties in a knowledge base. This is achieved by combining multi-lingual semantic role labeling (SRL) with cross-lingual entity linking followed by spectral clustering of the annotated SRL graphs. With our initial implementation we learned a cross-lingual lexicon of relation expressions from English and Spanish Wikipedia articles. To demonstrate its usefulness we apply it to crosslingual question answering over linked data."

The approach uses predicateargument representations of questions to derive equivalent combinations of SPARQL query fragments and text queries. These are executed so as to integrate the results of the text queries into SPARQL and thus generate a formal interpretation of the query. We present a thorough evaluation of the framework, including an analysis of the influence of entity annotation tools on the generation process of the hybrid queries and a study of the overall accuracy of the system.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2015_fiorelli_metadata_module/,"The OntoLex W3C Community Group has been working for more than three years on a shared lexicon model for ontologies, called lemon. The lemon model consists of a core model that is complemented by a number of modules accounting for specific aspects in the modeling of lexical information within ontologies. In many usage scenarios, the discovery and exploitation of linguistically grounded ontologies may benefit from summarizing information about their linguistic expressivity and lexical coverage by means of metadata. That situation is compounded by the fact that lemon allows the independent publication of ontologies, lexica and lexicalizations linking them. While the VoID vocabulary already addresses the need for general metadata about interlinked datasets, it is unable by itself to represent the more specific metadata relevant to lemon. To solve this problem, we developed a module of lemon, named LIME (Linguistic Metadata), which extends VoID with a vocabulary of metadata about the ontology-lexicon interface."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2015_peters_reasoning/,"Although recent developments have shown that it is possible to reason over large RDF datasets with billions of triples in a scalable way, the reasoning process can still be a challenging task with respect to the growing amount of available semantic data. By now, reasoner implementations that are able to process large scale datasets usually use a MapReduce based implementation that runs on a cluster of computing nodes. In this paper we address this circumstance by identifying the resource consuming parts of a reasoner process and providing a solution for a more efficient implementation in terms of memory consumption. As a basis we use a rule-based reasoner concept from our previous work. In detail, we are going to introduce an approach for a memory efficient RETE algorithm implementation. Furthermore, we introduce a compressed triple-index structure that can be used to identify duplicate triples and only needs a few bytes to represent a triple. Based on these concepts we show that it is possible to apply all RDFS rules to more than 1 billion triples on a single laptop reaching a throughput, that is comparable or even higher than state of the art MapReduce based reasoner. Thus, we show that the resources needed for large scale lightweight reasoning can massively be reduced."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2015_hartig_sparql_paths/,"As of today, there exists no standard language for querying Linked Data on the Web, where navigation across distributed data sources is a key feature. A natural candidate seems to be SPARQL, which recently has been enhanced with navigational capabilities thanks to the introduction of property paths (PPs). However, the semantics of SPARQL restricts the scope of navigation via PPs to single RDF graphs. This restriction limits the applicability of PPs on the Web. To fill this gap, in this paper we provide formal foundations for evaluating PPs on the Web, thus contributing to the definition of a query language for Linked Data. In particular, we introduce a query semantics for PPs that couples navigation at the data level with navigation on the Web graph. Given this semantics we find that for some PP-based SPARQL queries a complete evaluation on the Web is not feasible. To enable systems to identify queries that can be evaluated completely, we establish a decidable syntactic property of such queries."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2015_mutharaju_scalable_reasoning/,"OWL 2 EL is one of the tractable profiles of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) which is a W3C-recommended standard. OWL 2 EL provides sufficient expressivity to model large biomedical ontologies as well as streaming data such as traffic, while at the same time allows for efficient reasoning services. Existing reasoners for OWL 2 EL, however, use only a single machine and are thus constrained by memory and computational power. At the same time, the automated generation of ontological information from streaming data and text can lead to very large ontologies which can exceed the capacities of these reasoners. We thus describe a distributed reasoning system that scales well using a cluster of commodity machines. We also apply our system to a use case on city traffic data and show that it can handle volumes which cannot be handled by current single machine reasoners."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2015_beek_semantic_web/,"Ad-hoc querying is crucial to access information from Linked Data, yet publishing queryable RDF datasets on the Web is not a trivial exercise. The most compelling argument to support this claim is that the Web contains hundreds of thousands of data documents, while only 260 queryable SPARQL endpoints are provided. Even worse, the SPARQL endpoints we do have are often unstable, may not comply with the standards, and may differ in supported features. In other words, hosting data online is easy, but publishing Linked Data via a queryable API such as SPARQL appears to be too difficult. As a consequence, in practice, there is no single uniform way to query the LOD Cloud today. In this paper, we therefore combine a large-scale Linked Data publication project (LOD Laundromat) with a low-cost server-side interface (Triple Pattern Fragments), in order to bridge the gap between the Web of downloadable data documents and the Web of live queryable data. The result is a repeatable, low-cost, open-source data publication process. To demonstrate its applicability, we made over 650,000 data documents available as data APIs, consisting of 30 billion triples."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2015_ibragimov_sparql_endpoints/,"More andmore RDF data is exposed on theWeb via SPARQL endpoints. With the recent SPARQL 1.1 standard, these datasets can be queried in novel and more powerful ways, e.g., complex analysis tasks involving grouping and aggregation, and even data frommultiple SPARQL endpoints, can now be formulated in a single query. This enables Business Intelligence applications that access data from federated web sources and can combine it with local data. However, as both aggregate and federated queries have become available only recently, state-of-the-art systems lack sophisticated optimization techniques that facilitate efficient execution of such queries over large datasets. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a set of query processing strategies and the associated Costbased Optimizer for Distributed Aggregate queries (CoDA) for executing aggregate SPARQL queries over federations of SPARQL endpoints. Our comprehensive experiments show that CoDA significantly improves performance over current state-of-the-art systems."

Query relaxation is one of the cooperative techniques that allows providing users with alternative answers instead of an empty result. While previous works on query relaxation over RDF data have focused on defining new relaxation operators, we investigate in this paper techniques to find the parts of an RDF query that are responsible of its failure. Finding such subqueries, named Minimal Failing Subqueries (MFSs), is of great interest to efficiently perform the relaxation process. We propose two algorithmic approaches for computing MFSs. The first approach (LBA) intelligently leverages the subquery lattice of the initial RDF query while the second approach (MBA) is based on a particular matrix that improves the performance of LBA. Our approaches also compute a particular kind of relaxed RDF queries, called Maximal Succeeding Subqueries (XSSs). XSSs are subqueries with a maximal number of triple patterns of the initial query. To validate our approaches, a set of thorough experiments is conducted on the LUBM benchmark and a comparative study with other approaches is done."

The previously proposed query execution algorithm uses more http requests than necessary, and only makes partial use of the available metadata. In this paper, we propose a new query execution algorithm for a client communicating with a tpf server. In contrast to a greedy solution, we maintain an overview of the entire query to find the optimal steps for solving a given query. We show multiple cases in which our algorithm reaches solutions with far fewer http requests, without significantly increasing the cost in other cases. This improves the efficiency of common sparql queries against tpf interfaces, augmenting their viability compared to the more powerful, but more costly, sparql interface."

Although, links between diseases and symptoms can be found, these links are far too sparse to enable practical applications such as a disease-centric access to clinical reports that are annotated with symptom information. For this purpose, we build a model of disease-symptom relations. Utilizing existing ontology mappings, we propagate semantic type information for disease and symptom across ontologies. Then entities of the same semantic type from different ontologies are clustered and object properties between entities are mapped to cluster-level relations. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by integrating all available disease-symptom relations from different biomedical ontologies resulting in a significantly increased linkage between datasets."

To ease the emergence of these new applications, we propose a querybiased algorithm (LDRANK) for the ranking of web of data resources with associated textual data.

Existing approaches to predict the location of users, based on their tweets, rely solely on social media features or probabilistic language models. These approaches are supervised and require large training dataset of geo-tagged tweets to build their models. As most Twitter users are reluctant to publish their location, the collection of geo-tagged tweets is a time intensive process.

Our approach differs from existing approaches in that we take a holistic view of the data values corresponding to a semantic label and use techniques that treat this data collectively, which makes it possible to capture characteristic properties of the values associated with a semantic label as a whole.

However, themajority voting procedure, exploited for deciding the membership, does not consider explicitly the uncertainty and the conflict among the classifiers of an ensemble model. Moving from this observation, we propose to integrate the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory with ensemble learning. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for learning Evidential Terminological Random Forest models, an extension of Terminological Random Forests along with the DS theory. An empirical evaluation showed that: (i) the resulting models performs better for datasets with a lot of positive and negative examples and have a less conservative behavior than the voting-based forests; (ii) the new extension decreases the variance of the results."

We show by means of a survey of live RDF data sources that caching metadata is prevalent enough already to be used in some cases.

In our approach, we address the existing limitations of Tries for RDF data, and propose a new variant of Trie which contains some optimizations explicitly designed to improve the performance on RDF data. Furthermore, we show how we use this Trie as an in-memory dictionary by using as numerical ID a memory address instead of an integer counter. This design removes the need for an additional decoding data structure, and further reduces the occupied memory.

When using evidence sources which are heterogeneous in quality, amount of data provided and type, then a number of questions arise, for example: How many sources are needed to see significant benefits from heterogeneity, what is an appropriate number of evidences per source, is balancing the number of evidences per source important, and to what degree can the integration of multiple sources overcome low quality input of individual sources? This research presents an extensive evaluation based on an existing OL system. It gives answers and insights on the research questions posed for the OL task of concept detection, and provides further hints from experience made.

We especially highlight its ability to help users formulate better search queries. An example of a permitted query is in Croatia at the seaside where there is Vegetarian Restaurant. We conducted two experiments to evaluate the Query Auto-completion mechanism. The results showed that our system outperforms the Google Custom Search baseline. Queries freely conducted in RE-ONE are shown to be 63.4 % longer in terms of number of words and 27 % richer in terms of number of search criteria. RE-ONE supports better users’ query formulation process by giving suggestions in greater accordance with users’ idea flow."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2015_meusel_schema_org/,"Being promoted by major search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and Yandex, Microdata embedded in web pages, especially using schema.org, has become one of the most important markup languages for the Web. However, deployed Microdata is most often not free from errors, which limits its practical use. In this paper, we use the WebDataCommons corpus of Microdata extracted from more than 250 million web pages for a quantitative analysis of common mistakes in Microdata provision. Since it is unrealistic that data providers will provide clean and correct data, we discuss a set of heuristics that can be applied on the data consumer side to fix many of those mistakes in a post-processing step. We apply those heuristics to provide an improved knowledge base constructed from the raw Microdata extraction."

Due to their hierarchical structure and their string serialization, sets of related URIs typically contain a high degree of redundant information and are systematically dictionarycompressed or encoded at the back-end (e.g., in the triple store). The paper represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic comparison of the most common data structures used to encode URI data.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2014_staab_semantic_web/,"The Semantic Web changes the way we deal with data, because assumptions about the nature of the data that we deal with differ substantially from the ones in established database approaches. Semantic Web data is (i) provided by different people in an ad-hoc manner, (ii) distributed, (iii) semi-structured, (iv) (more or less) typed, (v) supposed to be used serendipitously. In fact, these are highly relevant assumptions and challenges, because they are frequently encountered in all kind of data-centric challenges – also in cases where Semantic Web standards are not in use. However, they are only partially accounted for in existing programming approaches for Semantic Web data including (i) semantic search, (ii) graph programming, and (iii) traditional database programming approaches.  The main hypothesis of this talk is that we have not yet developed the right kind of programming paradigms to deal with the proper nature of Semantic Web data, because none of the mentioned approaches fully considers its characteristics.

I then suggest an intuitive way in which they can all be linked in a conceptual, unified view. Against this background, in the second part, I outline a new concept of complexity, which I shall call coordination complexity. This completes the unified view. I then argue, in the third part, that the semantic web helps us dealing with problems with increasingly high degree of coordination complexity, which require the mobilisation of whole systems to be tackled. In the last and concluding part, I highlight one of the consequences of the resolution of problems with high degree of coordination complexity: the predictability and manipulability of autonomous choices."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2014_tresp_machine_learning/,"Most successful applications of statistical machine learning focus on response learning or signal-reaction learning where an output is produced as a direct response to an input. An important feature is a quick response time, the basis for, e.g., real-time ad-placement on the Web, real-time address reading in postal automation, or a fast reaction to threats for a biological being. One might argue that knowledge about specific world entities and their relationships is necessary if the complexity of an agent's world increases, for example if an agent needs to function in a complex social community. As one is quite aware in the Semantic Web community, a natural representation of knowledge about entities and their relationships is a directed labeled graph where nodes represent entities and where a labeled link stands for a true fact. A number of successful graph-based knowledge representations, such as DBpedia, YAGO, or the Google Knowledge Graph, have recently been developed and are the basis of applications ranging from the support of search to the realization of question answering systems. Statistical machine learning can play an important role in knowledge graphs as well. By exploiting statistical relational patterns one can predict the likelihood of new facts, find entity clusters and determine if two entities refer to the same real world object. Furthermore, one can analyze new entities and map them to existing entities (recognition) and predict likely relations for the new entity. These learning tasks can elegantly be approached by first transforming the knowledge graph into a 3-way tensor where two of the modes represent the entities in the domain and the third mode represents the relation type. Generalization is achieved by tensor factorization using, e.g., the RESCAL approach. A particular feature of RESCAL is that it exhibits collective learning where information can propagate in the knowledge graph to support a learning task. In the presentation the RESCAL approach will be introduced and applications of RESCAL to different learning and decision tasks will be presented."

Consensus partition is used to aggregate all distributed user-judged coreference results and resolve their disagreements. To alleviate user involvement, ensemble learning is performed on the consensus partition to automatically identify coreferent entities that users have not judged. We integrate coCoref into an online Linked Data browsing system, so that users can participate in entity coreference with their daily Web activities.

The probability of co-reference increases further when considering distributed SPARQL queries over a larger set of distributed datasets. Addressing co-reference in Linked Data queries, on one hand, increases complexity of query processing. On the other hand, it requires changes in how statistics of datasets are taken into consideration. We investigate these two challenges of addressing co-reference in distributed SPARQL queries, and propose two methods to improve query efficiency: 1) a model named Virtual Graph, that trans- forms a query with co-reference into a normal query with pre-existing bindings; 2) an algorithm named, that intensively exploits parallelism, and dynamically optimises queries using runtime statistics. We deploy both methods in an distributed engine called LHD-d. To evaluate LHD-d, we investigate the distribution of co-reference in the real world, based on which we simulate an experimental RDF network. In this environment we demonstrate the advantages of LHD-d for distributed SPARQL queries in environments with co-reference"

Whereas reducing the number of verification tasks is a major consideration for these approaches, very little attention has been paid to the efficiency of performing each single verification task. To address this issue, in this paper, instead of showing the entire descriptions of two entities for verification which are possibly lengthy, we propose to extract and present a compact summary of them, and expect that such length-limited comparative entity summaries can help human users verify more efficiently without significantly hurting the accuracy of the their verification. Our approach exploits the common and different features of two entities that best help indicate (non-)coreference, and also considers the diverse information on their identities.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2014_stoilos_data_access/,"n previous work it has been shown how an OWL 2 DL ontology O can be `repaired' for an OWL 2 RL system ans that is, how we can compute a set of axioms R that is independent from the data and such that ans that is generally incomplete for O becomes complete for all SPARQL queries when used with O [ R. However, the initial implementation and experiments were very preliminary and hence it is currently unclear whether the approach can be applied to large and complex ontologies. Moreover, the approach so far can only support instance queries. In the current paper we thoroughly investigate repairing as an approach to scalable (and complete) ontology-based data access. First, we present several non-trivial optimisations to the rst prototype. Second, we show how (arbitrary) conjunctive queries can be supported by integrating well-known query rewriting techniques with OWL 2 RL systems via repairing. Third, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation obtaining encouraging results. In more detail, our results show that we can compute repairs even for very large real-world ontologies in a reasonable amount of time, that the performance overhead introduced by repairing is negligible in small to medium sized ontologies and noticeable but manageable in large and complex one, and that the hybrid reasoning approach can very efficiently compute the correct answers for real-world challenging scenarios"
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_motta_semantic/,"Twelve years after the publication of the seminal article by Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler and Ora Lassila, which expounded the vision of a Semantic Web characterised by dynamic and large scale agent interoperability, the Semantic Web still distinctly lacks a “wow factor”. Many SW applications exist, but too often they are characterised by few data sources put together at compile time to drive some relatively simple user functionality. In many cases it is difficult to identify the competitive advantage that ‘being semantic’ affords these applications, compared to systems built using conventional technologies. Of course, one could argue that this is not necessarily a problem: the success of an area is measured in terms of its academic vitality and its impact on commerce and society. However, I would argue that there is actually a problem here and in my talk I will analyse these issues by examining how the notion of semantics is used in our community, highlighting the productive and unproductive uses of the term, and in particular describing the different ways in which semantics can be effectively exploited to provide added value to applications. The key message is that while there are many ways to exploit semantics to develop better functionalities, as a community we need to develop a better understanding (both fundamentally and pragmatically) of the value proposition afforded by the use of semantics. Without such understanding there is a risk that we will fail to take full advantage of the technologies that we are developing and the opportunities they create for us."

As we wrestle with our ontologies, alignments, inference methods, entity extractions and triple stores, it's easy to lose track of the vast majority of users who have no idea what any of these things are, who they help, or what problems they'll solve. In this talk, I'll adopt the perspective of these end users. I'll identify a number of information management problems faced by them---such as organizing their personal information, communicating effectively on the web, and handling their incoming information overload.  The Semantic Web can play a key role in solving these problems.  But what will matter most to end users is not the details of the Semantic Web's syntax, model, or algorithms, but rather the interfaces and workflows through which end users interact with it. I will describe key characteristics of these interfaces and workflows, and offer an overview of the research that needs to be done to develop them as effective solutions for end users."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_hauswirth_data/,"It is well established that we produce humongous amounts of information - technical infrastructures (smart grid, smart cities), the Social Web (Twitter, social networks, blogs), information systems (e-commerce, e-health), the media (newspapers, broadcasters), the Internet of Things, mobile phones, and many more - and that these amounts are growing exponentially. Linked Data gives us the technical means to network all this information and enables us to develop new forms of analytics on networked data from many sources instead of traditional ""monolithic"" data analytics. But this network of information is ""in-discrete"" as the data is produced continuously and at potentially high speeds with varying loads and demands on the producer and the consumer sides. This calls for new data/knowledge management approaches and as a result, the Linked Data world is slowly moving from a simplifying discrete model to a more realistic continuous view. This development impacts on and changes research problems in all areas and for all layers and requires well-orchestrated research efforts in and across research communities to support ""streaming"" as an integrated paradigm. In this talk, I will present a comprehensive stack of Linked Stream management approaches for all layers - from the Internet of Things to backend information systems, and will discuss the impact of streams on big data, analytics, and privacy."

In this paper we describe a landscape analysis of several tools, either conceived specifically for KE on the Semantic Web, or adaptable to it, or even acting as aggregators of extracted data from other tools.

An RDF model supports interoperability of these steps, and also provides a flexible way of including existing NLP tools and further knowledge sources. From 2000 news articles we construct a custom taxonomy with 10,000 concepts and 12,700 relations, similar in structure to manually created counterparts. Evaluation by 15 human judges shows the precision to be 89% and 90% for concepts and relations respectively; recall was 75% with respect to a manually generated taxonomy for the same domain."

http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_palmero_aprosio_expansion/,"DBpedia is a project aiming to represent Wikipedia content in RDF triples. It plays a central role in the Semantic Web, due to the large and growing number of resources linked to it. Nowadays, only 1.7M Wikipedia pages are deeply classified in the DBpedia ontology, although the English Wikipedia contains almost 4M pages, showing a clear problem of coverage. In other languages (like French and Spanish) this coverage is even lower. The objective of this paper is to define a methodology to increase the coverage of DBpedia in different languages. The major problems that we have to solve concern the high number of classes involved in the DBpedia ontology and the lack of coverage for some classes in certain languages. In order to deal with these problems, we first extend the population of the classes for the different languages by connecting the corresponding Wikipedia pages through cross-language links. Then, we train a supervised classifier using this extended set as training data. We evaluated our system using a manually annotated test set, demonstrating that our approach can add more than 1M new entities to DBpedia with high precision (90%) and recall (50%). The resulting resource is available through a SPARQL endpoint and a downloadable package."

The grammar restricts the wiki content to a well-defined subset of Attempto Controlled English (ACE), and facilitates a precise bidirectional automatic translation between ACE and language fragments of a number of other natural languages, making the wiki content accessible multilingually. Additionally, our approach allows for automatic translation into the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which enables automatic reasoning over the wiki content. The developed wiki environment thus allows users to build, query and view OWL knowledge bases via a user-friendly multilingual natural language interface. As a further feature, the underlying multilingual grammar is integrated into the wiki and can be collaboratively edited to extend the vocabulary of the wiki or even customize its sentence structures. This work demonstrates the combination of the existing technologies of Attempto Controlled English and Grammatical Framework, and is implemented as an extension of the existing semantic wiki engine AceWiki."

By utilizing Sparql, Web sites and services can consume this data and present it in a user-friendly form, e.g., in mash-ups. To gather RDF triples for this task, machine agents typically issue similarly structured queries with recurring patterns against the Sparql endpoint. These queries usually differ only in a small number of individual triple pattern parts, such as resource labels or literals in objects. We present an approach to detect such recurring patterns in queries and introduce the notion of query templates, which represent clusters of similar queries exhibiting these recurrences. We describe a matching algorithm to extract query templates and illustrate the benefits of prefetching data by utilizing these templates. Finally, we comment on the applicability of our approach using results from real-world Sparql query logs."

Incorrect use of ontology concepts and class properties impede the goal of machine readability and knowledge discovery. For example, users searching for movies with a certain artist cannot rely on a single given property artist, because some movies may be connected to that artist by the predicate starring. In addition, the information need of a data consumer may not always be clear and her interpretation of given schemata may differ from the intentions of the ontology engineer or data publisher. It is thus necessary to either support users during query formulation or to incorporate implicitly related facts through predicate expansion. To this end, we introduce a data-driven synonym discovery algorithm for predicate expansion. We applied our algorithm to various data sets as shown in a thorough evaluation of different strategies and rule-based techniques for this purpose."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_zhao_knowledge/,"The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud contains tremendous amounts of interlinked instances, from where we can retrieve abundant knowledge. However, because of the heterogeneous and big ontologies, it is time consuming to learn all the ontologies manually and it is difficult to observe which properties are important for describing instances of a specific class. In order to construct an ontology that can help users easily access to various data sets, we propose a semi-automatic ontology integration framework that can reduce the heterogeneity of ontologies and retrieve frequently used core properties for each class. The framework consists of three main components: graph-based ontology integration, machine-learning-based ontology schema extraction, and an ontology merger. By analyzing the instances of the linked data sets, this framework acquires ontological knowledge and constructs a high-quality integrated ontology, which is easily understandable and effective in knowledge acquisition from various data sets using simple SPARQL queries."

Unlike other compression techniques, our approach not only takes advantage of syntactic verbosity and data redundancy but also utilizes semantic associations present in the RDF graph. Depending on the nature of the dataset, our system is able to prune more than 50% of the original triples without affecting data integrity."

We proceed by steps: we start by supporting the SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store Protocol, and we shift towards a SPARQL-less solution for the Linked Data Platform.

Next we look at changes within the RDF content of the core documents across the weekly snapshots, examining the elements (i.e., triples, subjects, predicates, objects, classes) that are most frequently added or removed.

In this paper, we present a method and metrics to analyse the information theoretic properties and the correlation between the two manifestations of schema information. Furthermore, we actually perform such an analysis on large-scale linked data sets. To this end, we have extracted schema information regarding the types and properties defined in the data set segments provided for the Billion Triples Challenge 2012. We have conducted an in depth analysis and have computed various entropy measures as well as the mutual information encoded in the two types of schema information. Our analysis provides insights into the information encoded in the different schema characteristics. Two major findings are that implicit schema information is far more discriminative and that applications involving schema information based on either types or properties alone will only capture between 63.5% and 88.1% of the schema information contained in the data. Based on these observations, we derive conclusions about the design of future schemas for LOD as well as potential application scenarios."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_schneider_conjunctive_query/,"With the advent of publicly available geospatial data, ontology-based data access (OBDA) over spatial data has gained increasing interest. Spatiorelational DBMSs are used to implement geographic information systems (GIS) and are fit to manage large amounts of data and geographic objects such as points, lines, polygons, etc. In this paper, we extend the Description Logic DL-Lite with spatial objects and show how to answer spatial conjunctive queries (SCQs) over ontologies—that is, conjunctive queries with point-set topological relations such as next and within —expressed in this language. The goal of this extension is to enable an off-the-shelf use of spatio-relational DBMSs to answer SCQs using rewriting techniques, where data sources and geographic objects are stored in a database and spatial conjunctive queries are rewritten to SQL statements with spatial functions. Furthermore, we consider keyword-based querying over spatial OBDA data sources, and show how to map queries expressed as simple keyword lists describing objects of interest to SCQs, using a meta-model for completing the SCQs with spatial aspects. We have implemented our lightweight approach to spatial OBDA in a prototype and show initial experimental results using data sources such as Open Street Maps and Open Government Data Vienna from an associated project. We show that for real-world scenarios, practical queries are expressible under meta-model completion, and that query answering is computationally feasible."

Yet, so far, little attention has been paid to the management of hardware resources for the execution of link discovery tasks. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating the efficient use of hardware resources for link discovery. We implement the HR3 approach for three different parallel processing paradigms including the use of GPUs and MapReduce platforms. We also perform a thorough performance comparison for these implementations. Our results show that certain tasks that appear to require cloud computing techniques can actually be accomplished using standard parallel hardware.

A more direct approach than ROLAP is to load Statistical Linked Data into an RDF store and to answer OLAP queries using SPARQL. However, we assume that general-purpose triple stores – just as typical relational databases – are no perfect fit for analytical workloads and need to be complemented by OLAP-to-SPARQL engines. To give an empirical argument for the need of such an engine, we first compare the performance of our generated SPARQL and of ROLAP SQL queries. Second, we measure the performance gain of RDF aggregate views that, similar to aggregate tables in ROLAP, materialise parts of the data cube."

http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_kuhn_scope/,"In this paper, we present an approach for extending the existing concept of nanopublications — tiny entities of scientific results in RDF representation — to broaden their application range. The proposed extension uses English sentences to represent informal and underspecified scientific claims. These sentences follow a syntactic and semantic scheme that we call AIDA (Atomic, Independent, Declarative, Absolute), which provides a uniform and succinct representation of scientific assertions. Such AIDA nanopublications are compatible with the existing nanopublication concept and enjoy most of its advantages such as information sharing, interlinking of scientific findings, and detailed attribution, while being more flexible and applicable to a much wider range of scientific results. We show that users are able to create AIDA sentences for given scientific results quickly and at high quality, and that it is feasible to automatically extract and interlink AIDA nanopublications from existing unstructured data sources. To demonstrate our approach, a web-based interface is introduced, which also exemplifies the use of nanopublications for non-scientific content, including meta-nanopublications that describe other nanopublications."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_wagner_twitter/,"Interpreting the meaning of a document represents a fundamental challenge for current semantic analysis methods. One interesting aspect mostly neglected by existing methods is that authors of a document usually assume certain background knowledge of their intended audience. Based on this knowledge, authors usually decide what to communicate and how to communicate it. Traditionally, this kind of knowledge has been elusive to semantic analysis methods. However, with the rise of social media such as Twitter, background knowledge of intended audiences (i.e., the community of potential readers) has become explicit to some extents, i.e., it can be modeled and estimated. In this paper, we (i) systematically compare different methods for estimating background knowledge of different audiences on Twitter and (ii) investigate to what extent the background knowledge of audiences is useful for interpreting the meaning of social media messages. We find that estimating the background knowledge of social media audiences may indeed be useful for interpreting the meaning of social media messages, but that its utility depends on manifested structural characteristics of message streams."

In this paper, we address exactly this drawback by presenting the concept of the correlation-aware active learning of link specifications. We then present two generic approaches that implement this concept. The first approach is based on graph clustering and can make use of intra-class correlation. The second relies on the activation-spreading paradigm and can make use of both intra- and inter-class correlations. We evaluate the accuracy of these approaches and compare them against a state-of-the-art link specification learning approach in ten different settings.

Our framework supports the detection and repairing of missing and wrong is-a structure in taxonomies, as well as the detection and repairing of missing (alignment) and wrong mappin gaps between ontologies.

In addition, a mapping selection module is introduced to filter out the most likely mapping candidates. This paper proposes an empirical study of the interaction between these components working together inside an ontology matching system. By the help of datasets from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative, we have carried out several experimental studies. In the first place, we have been interested in the impact of the mapping selection module on the performance of terminological and structural matchers revealing the advantage of using global methods vs. local ones. Further, we have carried an extensive study on the flaw of the performance of a structural matcher in the presence of noisy input coming from a terminological method.

This is achieved by introducing different kinds of interruptable sessions. The framework allows partial computations for generating mapping suggestions, partial validations of mappings suggestions and use of validation decisions in (re)computation of mapping suggestions and the recommendation of alignment strategies to use.

http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_dragoni_multilingual_ontology/,"Evolving complex artifacts as multilingual ontologies is a difficult activity demanding for the involvement of different roles and for guidelines to drive and coordinate them. We present the methodology and the underlying tool that have been used in the context of the Organic. Lingua project for the collaborative evolution of the multilingual Organic Agriculture ontology. Findings gathered from a quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of the experience are reported, revealing the usefulness of the methodology used in synergy with the tool."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_stolz_bmecat/,"To date, the automatic exchange of product information between business partners in a value chain is typically done using Business-to Business (B2B) catalog standards such as EDIFACT, cXML, or BMEcat. At the same time, the Web of Data, in particular the GoodRelations vocabulary, others the necessary means to publish highly-structured product data in a machine-readable format. The advantage of the publication of rich product descriptions can be manifold, including better integration and exchange of information between Web applications, high-quality data along the various stages of the value chain, or the opportunity to support more precise and more efective searches. In this paper, we (1) stress the importance of rich product master data for e-commerce on the Semantic Web, and (2) present a tool to convert BMEcat XML data sources into an RDF-based data model anchored in the GoodRelations vocabulary. The benefits of our proposal are tested using product data collected from a set of 2500+ online retailers of varying sizes and domains."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_hees_khamis_collecting_links/,"In recent years, the ongoing adoption of Semantic Web technologies has lead to a large amount of Linked Data that has been generated. While in the early days of the Semantic Web we were fighting data scarcity, nowadays we suffer from an overflow of information. In many situations we want to restrict the amount of facts which is shown to an end-user or passed on to another system to just the most important ones. In this paper we propose to rank facts in accordance to human association strengths between concepts. In order to collect a ground truth we developed a Family Feud like web-game called “Knowledge Test Game”. Given a Linked Data entity it collects other associated Linked Data entities from its players. We explain the game’s concept, its suggestion box which maps the players’ text input back to Linked Data entities and include a detailed evaluation of the game showing promising results. The collected data is published and can be used to evaluate algorithms which rank facts."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_wade_results_categorization/,"As the size of the Linked Open Data (LOD) increases, searching and exploring LOD becomes more challenging. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel personalized search and exploration mechanism for the Web of Data (WoD) based on concept based results categorization. In our approach , search results (LOD resources) are conceptually categorized into UMBEL concepts to form concept lenses, which assist exploratory search and browsing. When the user selects a concept lens for exploration, results are immediately personalized. In particular, all concept lenses are personally reorganized according to their similarity to the selected concept lens using a similarity measure. Within the selected concept lens; more relevant results are included using results re-ranking and query expansion, as well as relevant concept lenses are suggested to support results exploration. This is an innovative feature offered by our approach since it allows dynamic adaptation of results to the user’s local choices. We also support interactive personalization; when the user clicks on a result, within the interacted lens, relevant categories and results are included using results re-ranking and query expansion. Our personalization approach is non intrusive, privacy preserving and scalable since it does not require log in and implemented at the client side. To evaluate efficacy of the proposed personalized search, a benchmark was created on a tourism domain. The results showed that the proposed approach performs significantly better than a non adaptive baseline concept based search and traditional ranked list present action."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_fetahu_entity_linking/,"One key feature of the Semantic Web lies in the ability to link related Web resources. However, while relations within particular data sets are often well-defined, links between disparate data sets and corpora of Web resources are rare. The increasingly widespread use of cross-domain reference data sets, such as Freebase and DBpedia for annotating and enriching data sets as well as documents, opens up opportunities to exploit their inherent semantic relationships to align disparate Web resources. In this paper, we present a combined approach to uncover relationships between disparate entities which exploits (a) graph analysis of reference data sets together with (b) entity co-occurrence on the Web with the help of search engines. In (a), we introduce a novel approach adopted and applied from social network theory to measure the connectivity between given entities in reference data sets. The connectivity measures are used to identify connected Web resources. Finally, we present a thorough evaluation of our approach using a publicly available data set and introduce a comparison with established measures in the field."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_carral_scheider_map_scaling/,"The concepts of scale is at the core of cartographic abstraction and mapping. It denes which geographic phenomena should be displayed, which type of geometry and map symbol to use, which measures can be taken, as well as the degree to which features need to be exaggerated or spatially displaced. In this work, we present an ontology design pattern for map scaling using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) within a particular extension of the OWL RL prole. We explain how it can be used to describe scaling applications, to reason over scale levels, and geometric representations. We propose an axiomatization that allows us to impose meaningful constraints on the pattern, and, thus, to go beyond simple surface semantics. Interestingly, this includes several functional constraints currently not expressible in any of the OWL proles. We show that for this specific scenario, the addition of such constraints does not increase the reasoning complexity which remains tractable."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_scheglmann_concurrent_transactions/,"Collaborative editing on large-scale ontologies imposes serious demands on concurrent modifications and con ict resolution. In order to enable robust handling of concurrent modications, we propose a locking-based approach that ensures independent transactions to simultaneously work on an ontology while blocking those transactions that might in uence other transactions. In the logical context of ontologies, dependence and independence of transactions do not only rely on the single data items that are modified, but also on the inferences drawn from these items. In order to address this issue, we utilize logical modularization of ontologies and lock the parts of the ontology that share inferential dependencies for an ongoing transaction. We compare and evaluate modularization and the naive approach of locking the whole ontology for each transaction and analyze the trade-o between the time needed for computing locks and the time gained by running transactions concurrently."
http://videolectures.net/eswc2013_power_owl_inferences/,"In this paper, we describe a method for predicting the understandability level of inferences with OWL. Specically, we present a probabilistic model for measuring the understandability of a multiple step inference based on the measurement of the understandability of individual inference steps. We also present an evaluation study which conrms that our model works relatively well for two-step inferences with OWL. This model has been applied in our research on generating accessible explanations for an entailment of OWL ontologies, to determine the most understandable inference among alternatives, from which the nal explanation is generated."
