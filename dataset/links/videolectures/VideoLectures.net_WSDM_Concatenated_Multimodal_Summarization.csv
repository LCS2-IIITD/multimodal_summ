http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_shum_bdm/,"The decade-old Internet search outcomes, manifested in the form of “ten blue links,” are no longer sufficient for Internet users. Many studies have shown that when users are ushered off the conventional search result pages through blue links, their needs are often partially met at best in a “hit-or-miss” fashion. To tackle this challenge, we have designed Bing, Microsoft’s decision engine, to not just navigate users to a landing page through a blue link but to continue engaging with users to clarify intent and facilitate task completion. Underlying this new paradigm is the Bing Dialog Model that consists of three building blocks: an indexing system that comprehensively collects information from the web and systematically harvests knowledge, an intent model that statistically infers user intent and predicts next action, and an interaction model that elicits user intent through mathematically optimized presentations of web information and domain knowledge that matches user needs. In this talk, I’ll describe Bing Dialog Model in details and demonstrate it in action through some innovative features since the launch of www.Bing.com"
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_weber_wuw/,"We analyze a large query log of 2.3 million anonymous registered users from a web-scale U.S. search engine in order to jointly analyze their on-line behavior in terms of who they might be (demographics), what they search for (query topics), and how they search (session analysis). We examine basic demographics from registration information provided by the users, augmented with U.S. census data, analyze basic session statistics, classify queries into types (navigational, informational, transactional) based on click entropy, classify queries into topic categories, and cluster users based on the queries they issued. We then examine the resulting clusters in terms of demographics and search behavior. Our analysis of the data suggests that there are important differences in search behavior across different demographic groups in terms of the topics they search for, and how they search (e.g., white conservatives are those likely to have voted republican, mostly white males, who search for business, home, and gardening related topics; Baby Boomers tend to be primarily interested in Finance and a large fraction of their sessions consist of simple navigational queries related to online banking, etc.). Finally, we examine regional search differences, which seem to correlate with differences in local industries (e.g., gambling related queries are highest in Las Vegas and lowest in Salt Lake City; searches related to actors are about three times higher in L.A. than in any other region)."

We present a personalization approach that builds a user interest profile using users' complete browsing behavior, then uses this model to rerank web results. We show that using a combination of content and previously visited websites provides effective personalization. We extend previous work by proposing a number of techniques for filtering previously viewed content that greatly improve the user model used for personalization. Our approaches are compared to previous work in offline experiments and are evaluated against unpersonalized web search in large scale online tests. Large improvements are found in both cases."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_teevan_tsc/,"Social networking Web sites are not just places to maintain relationships; they can also be valuable information sources. However, little is known about how and why people search socially-generated content. In this paper we explore search behavior on the popular microblogging/social networking site Twitter. Using analysis of large-scale query logs and supplemental qualitative data, we observe that people search Twitter to find temporally relevant information (e.g., breaking news, real-time content, and popular trends) and information related to people (e.g., content directed at the searcher, information about people of interest, and general sentiment and opinion). Twitter queries are shorter, more popular, and less likely to evolve as part of a session than Web queries. It appears people repeat Twitter queries to monitor the associated search results, while changing and developing Web queries to learn about a topic. The results returned from the different corpora support these different uses, with Twitter results including more social chatter and social events, and Web results containing more basic facts and navigational content. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of next-generation Web search tools that incorporate social media."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_pal_ita/,"Content in microblogging systems such as Twitter is produced by tens to hundreds of millions of users. This diversity is a notable strength, but also presents the challenge of finding the most interesting and authoritative authors for any given topic. To address this, we first propose a set of features for characterizing social media authors, including both nodal and topical metrics. We then show how probabilistic clustering over this feature space, followed by a within-cluster ranking procedure, can yield a final list of top authors for a given topic. We present results across several topics, along with results from a user study confirming that our method finds authors who are significantly more interesting and authoritative than those resulting from several baseline conditions. Additionally our algorithm is computationally feasible in near real-time scenarios making it an attractive alternative for capturing the rapidly changing dynamics of microblogs."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_leskovec_cmd/,"Transmission of infectious diseases, propagation of information, and spread of ideas and influence through social networks are all examples of diffusion. In such cases we say that a contagion spreads through the network, a process that can be modeled by a cascade graph. Studying cascades and network diffusion is challenging due to missing data. Even a single missing observation in a sequence of propagation events can significantly alter our inferences about the diffusion process. We address the problem of missing data in information cascades. Specifically, given only a fraction C′ of the complete cascade C, our goal is to estimate the properties of the complete cascade C, such as its size or depth. To estimate the properties of C, we first formulate k-tree model of cascades and analytically study its properties in the face of missing data. We then propose a numerical method that given a cascade model and observed cascade C′ can estimate properties of the complete cascade C. We evaluate our methodology using information propagation cascades in the Twitter network (70 million nodes and 2 billion edges), as well as information cascades arising in the blogosphere. Our experiments show that the k-tree model is an effective tool to study the effects of missing data in cascades. Most importantly, we show that our method (and the k-tree model) can accurately estimate properties of the complete cascade C even when 90% of the data is missing."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_mason_iit/,"Word-of-mouth diffusion of information is of great interest to planners, marketers and social network researchers alike. In this work we investigate the attributes and relative influence of 1.6M Twitter users by tracking 39 million diffusion events that took place on the Twitter follower graph over a two month interval in 2009. We find that the largest cascades tend to be generated by users who have been influential in the past and from URLs that were rated more interesting and/or elicited more positive feelings by workers on Mechanical Turk. However, individual-level predictions of which user or URL will generate large cascades are relatively unreliable. We conclude, therefore, that word-of-mouth diffusion can only be harnessed reliably by targeting large numbers of potential influencers, thereby capturing average effects. Finally, we consider a family of hypothetical marketing strategies, and find that under a wide range of plausible assumptions the most cost-effective performance can be realized using ""ordinary influencers"" - individuals who exert average or even less-than-average influence."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_craswell_cac/,"Traditional editorial effectiveness measures, such as nDCG, remain standard for Web search evaluation. Unfortunately, these traditional measures can inappropriately reward redundant information and can fail to reflect the broad range of user needs that can underlie a Web query. To address these deficiencies, several researchers have recently proposed effectiveness measures for novelty and diversity. Many of these measures are based on simple cascade models of user behavior, which operate by considering the relationship between successive elements of a result list. The properties of these measures are still poorly understood, and it is not clear from prior research that they work as intended. In this paper we examine the properties and performance of cascade measures with the goal of validating them as tools for measuring effectiveness. We explore their commonalities and differences, placing them in a unified framework; we discuss their theoretical difficulties and limitations, and compare the measures experimentally, contrasting them against traditional measures and against other approaches to measuring novelty. Data collected by the TREC 2009 Web Track is used as the basis for our experimental comparison. Our results indicate that these measures reward systems that achieve an balance between novelty and overall precision in their result lists, as intended. Nonetheless, other measures provide insights not captured by the cascade measures, and we suggest that future evaluation efforts continue to report a variety of measures."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_teevan_upp/,"This paper presents an algorithm that predicts with very high accuracy which Web search result a user will click for one sixth of all Web queries. Prediction is done via a straightforward form of personalization that takes advantage of the fact that people often use search engines to re-find previously viewed resources. In our approach, an individual’s past navigational behavior is identified via query log analysis and used to forecast identical future navigational behavior by the same individual. We compare the potential value of personal navigation with general navigation identified using aggregate user behavior. Although consistent navigational behavior across users can be useful for identifying a subset of navigational queries, different people often use the same queries to navigate to different resources. This is true even for queries comprised of unambiguous company names or URLs and typically thought of as navigational. We build an understanding of what personal navigation looks like, and identify ways to improve its coverage and accuracy by taking advantage of people’s consistency over time and across groups of individuals."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_bendersky_qbr/,"Many existing retrieval approaches do not take into account the content quality of the retrieved documents, although link-based measures such as PageRank are commonly used as a form of document prior. In this paper, we present the quality-biased ranking method that promotes documents containing high-quality content, and penalizes low-quality documents. The quality of the document content can be determined by its readability, layout and ease-of-navigation, among other factors. Accordingly, instead of using a single estimate for document quality, we consider multiple content- based features that are directly integrated into a state-of- the-art retrieval method. These content-based features are easy to compute, store and retrieve, even for large web collections. We use several query sets and web collections to empirically evaluate the performance of our quality-biased retrieval method. In each case, our method consistently improves by a large margin the retrieval performance of text- based and link-based retrieval methods that do not take into account the quality of the document content."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_radinsky_rfp/,"Obtaining judgments from human raters is a vital part in the design of search engines’ evaluation. Today, there exists a discrepancy between judgment acquisition from raters (training phase) and use of the responses for retrieval evaluation (evaluation phase). This discrepancy is derived from the inconsistency between the representation of the information in both phases. During training, raters are requested to provide a relevance score for an individual result in the context of a query, whereas the evaluation is performed on ordered lists of search results, with the results’ relative position (compared to other results) is taken into account. As an alternative to the practice of learning to rank using relevance judgments for individual search results, more and more focus has recently been diverted to the theory and practice of learning from answers to combinatorial questions about sets of search results. That is, users, during training, are asked to rank small sets (typically pairs). We start by statistically comparing human rater response to questions on relevance of individual results versus questions on pairs of results. We empirically show that neither type of response can be deduced from the other, and that the added context created when results are shown together changes raters’ evaluation process. Since pairwise judgments are directly related to ranking, we conclude they are more accurate for that purpose. We go beyond pairs to show that triplets do not contain significantly much more information than pairs for the purpose of measuring statistical preference. These two results establish good stability properties of pairwise comparisons for the purpose of learning to rank. We further analyze different scenarios, in which results of varying quality are added as “decoy”. A recurring source of worry in papers focusing on pairwise comparison is the quadratic number of pairs in a set of results. Which preferences do we choose to solicit from paid raters? Can we provably eliminate a quadratic cost? We initiate a rigorous statistical learning theoretical study in the question of which and how many pairs we need to choose, and prove a result indicating that only O(n polylog n) pairs are required in order to obtain an almost perfect ordering. These pairs are chosen adaptively, and hence our scheme suggests an active learning algorithm."

We consider methods for finding the repeated n-grams in text corpora, with emphasis on techniques that can be effectively scaled across a cluster of processors to handle very large amounts of text. We compare our proposed method to existing techniques using the 1.5 TB TREC ClueWeb-B text collection, using both single-processor and multi-processor approaches. The experiments show that our method offers an important tradeoff between speed and temporary storage space, and provides an alternative to previous approaches that scales almost linearly in the length of the sequence, is largely independent of n, and provides a uniform workload balance across the set of available processors."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_ding_pvs/,"Large web search engines are now processing billions of queries per day. Most of these queries are interactive in nature, requiring a response in fractions of a second. However, there are also a number of important scenarios where large batches of queries are submitted for various web mining and system optimization tasks that do not require an immediate response. Given the significant cost of executing search queries over billions of web pages, it is a natural question to ask if such batches of queries can be more efficiently executed than interactive queries. In this paper, we motivate and discuss the problem of batch query processing in search engines, identify basic mechanisms for improving the performance of such queries, and provide a preliminary experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques. Our conclusion is that significant cost reductions are possible by using specialized mechanisms for executing batch queries in Web search engines."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_radlinski_duc/,"The web contains many duplicate and near-duplicate documents. Given that user satisfaction is negatively affected by redundant information in search results, a significant amount of research has been devoted to developing duplicate detection algorithms. However, most such algorithms rely solely on document content to detect duplication, ignoring the fact that a primary goal of duplicate detection is to identify documents that contain redundant information with respect to a particular user query. Similarly, although query-dependent result diversification algorithms compute a query-dependent ranking, they tend to do so on the basis of a query-independent content similarity score. In this paper, we bridge the gap between query-dependent redundancy and query-independent duplication by showing how user click behavior following a query provides evidence about the relative novelty of web documents. While most previous work on interpreting user clicks on search results has assumed that they reflect just result relevance, we show that clicks also provide information about duplication between web documents since users consider search results in the context of previously seen documents. Moreover, we find that duplication explains a substantial amount of presentation bias observed in clicking behavior. We identify three distinct types of redundancy that commonly occur on the web and show how click data can be used to detect these different types."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_mass_kmv/,"The problem of fully decentralized search over many collections is considered. The objective is to approximate the results of centralized search (namely, using a central index) while controlling the communication cost and involving only a small number of collections. The proposed solution is couched in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, but can also be applied in other setups. Peers publish per-term summaries of their collections. Specifically, for each term, the range of document scores is divided into intervals; and for each interval, a KMV (K Minimal Values) synopsis of its documents is created. A new peer-selection algorithm uses the KMV synopses and two scoring functions in order to adaptively rank the peers, according to the relevance of their documents to a given query. The proposed method achieves high-quality results while meeting the above criteria of efficiency. In particular, experiments are done on two large, real-world datasets; one is blogs and the other is web data. These experiments show that the algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and is robust over different collections, various scoring functions and multi-term queries."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_svore_utq/,"Web search is strongly influenced by time. The queries people issue change over time, with some queries occasionally spiking in popularity (e.g., earthquake) and others remaining relatively constant (e.g., youtube). The documents indexed by the search engine also change, with some documents always being about a particular query (e.g., the Wikipedia page on earthquakes is about the query earthquake) and others being about the query only at a particular point in time (e.g., the New York Times is only about earthquakes following a major seismic activity). The relationship between documents and queries can also change as people's intent changes (e.g., people sought different content for the query earthquake before the Haitian earthquake than they did after). In this paper, we explore how queries, their associated documents, and the query intent change over the course of 10 weeks by analyzing query log data, a daily Web crawl, and periodic human relevance judgments. We identify several interesting features by which changes to query popularity can be classified, and show that presence of these features, when accompanied by changes in result content, can be a good indicator of change in query intent."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_yang_tvo/,"Online content exhibits rich temporal dynamics, and diverse realtime user generated content further intensifies this process. However, temporal patterns by which online content grows and fades over time, and by which different pieces of content compete for attention remain largely unexplored. We study temporal patterns associated with online content and how the content’s popularity grows and fades over time. The attention that content receives on the Web varies depending on many factors and occurs on very different time scales and at different resolutions. In order to uncover the temporal dynamics of online content we formulate a time series clustering problem using a similarity metric that is invariant to scaling and shifting. We develop the K-Spectral Centroid (K-SC) clustering algorithm that effectively finds cluster centroids with our similarity measure. By applying an adaptive wavelet-based incremental approach to clustering, we scale K-SC to large data sets. We demonstrate our approach on two massive datasets: a set of 580 million Tweets, and a set of 170 million blog posts and news media articles. We find that K-SC outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm in finding distinct shapes of time series. Our analysis shows that there are six main temporal shapes of attention of online content. We also present a simple model that reliably predicts the shape of attention by using information about only a small number of participants. Our analyses offer insight into common temporal patterns of the content on theWeb and broaden the understanding of the dynamics of human attention."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_sakai_ugr/,"Community Question Answering (CQA) sites such as Yahoo! Answers have emerged as rich knowledge resources for information seekers. However, answers posted to CQA sites can be irrelevant, incomplete, redundant, incorrect, biased, ill-formed or even abusive. Hence, automatic selection of ""good"" answers for a given posted question is a practical research problem that will help us manage the quality of accumulated knowledge. One way to evaluate answer selection systems for CQA would be to use the Best Answers (BAs) that are readily available from the CQA sites. However, BAs may be biased, and even if they are not, there may be other good answers besides BAs. To remedy these two problems, we propose system evaluation methods that involve multiple answer assessors and graded-relevance information retrieval metrics. Our main findings from experiments using the NTCIR-8 CQA task data are that, using our evaluation methods, (a) we can detect many substantial differences between systems that would have been overlooked by BA-based evaluation; and (b) we can better identify hard questions (i.e. those that are handled poorly by many systems and therefore require focussed investigation) compared to BAbased evaluation. We therefore argue that our approach is useful for building effective CQA answer selection systems despite the cost of manual answer assessments."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_hoi_msi/,"With the popularity of various social media applications, massive social images associated with high quality tags have been made available in many social media web sites nowadays. Mining social images on the web has become an emerging important research topic in web search and data mining. In this paper, we propose a machine learning framework for mining social images and investigate its application to automated image tagging. To effectively discover knowledge from social images that are often associated with multimodal contents (including visual images and textual tags), we propose a novel Unified Distance Metric Learning (UDML) scheme, which not only exploits both visual and textual contents of social images, but also effectively unifies both inductive and transductive metric learning techniques in a systematic learning framework. We further develop an efficient stochastic gradient descent algorithm for solving the UDML optimization task and prove the convergence of the algorithm. By applying the proposed technique to the automated image tagging task in our experiments, we demonstrate that our technique is empirically effective and promising for mining social images towards some real applications."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_sarma_dre/,"This paper studies the problem of dynamic relationship and event discovery. A large body of previous work on relation extraction focuses on discovering predefined and static relationships between entities. In contrast, we aim to identify temporally defined (e.g., co-bursting) relationships that are not predefined by an existing schema, and we identify the underlying time constrained events that lead to these relationships. The key challenges in identifying such events include discovering and verifying dynamic connections among entities, and consolidating binary dynamic connections into events consisting of a set of entities that are connected at a given time period. We formalize this problem and introduce an efficient end-to-end pipeline as a solution. In particular, we introduce two formal notions, global temporal constraint cluster and local temporal constraint cluster, for detecting dynamic events. We further design efficient algorithms for discovering such events from a large graph of dynamic relationships. Finally, detailed experiments on real data show the effectiveness of our proposed solution."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_gupta_jto/,"We consider the problem of jointly training structured models for extraction from multiple web sources whose records enjoy partial content overlap. This has important applications in open-domain extraction, e.g. a user materializing a table of interest from multiple relevant unstructured sources; or a site like Freebase augmenting an incomplete relation by extracting more rows from web sources. Such applications require extraction over arbitrary domains, so one cannot use a pre-trained extractor or demand a huge labeled dataset. We propose to overcome this lack of supervision by using content overlap across the related web sources. Existing methods of exploiting overlap have been developed under settings that do not generalize easily to the scale and diversity of overlap seen on Web sources. We present an agreement-based learning framework that jointly trains the models by biasing them to agree on the agreement regions, i.e. shared text segments. We present alternatives within our framework to trade-off tractability, robustness to noise, and extent of agreement enforced; and propose a scheme of partitioning agreement regions that leads to efficient training while maximizing overall accuracy. Further, we present a principled scheme to discover low-noise agreement regions in unlabeled data across multiple sources. Through extensive experiments over 58 different extraction domains, we establish that our framework provides significant boosts over uncoupled training, and scores over alternatives such as collective inference, staged training, and multi-view learning."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_nakashole_skh/,"Harvesting relational facts from Web sources has received great attention for automatically constructing large knowledge bases. Stateof-the-art approaches combine pattern-based gathering of fact candidates with constraint-based reasoning. However, they still face major challenges regarding the trade-offs between precision, recall, and scalability. Techniques that scale well are susceptible to noisy patterns that degrade precision, while techniques that employ deep reasoning for high precision cannot cope with Web-scale data. This paper presents a scalable system, called PROSPERA, for high-quality knowledge harvesting. We propose a new notion of ngram-itemsets for richer patterns, and use MaxSat-based constraint reasoning on both the quality of patterns and the validity of fact candidates.We compute pattern-occurrence statistics for two benefits: they serve to prune the hypotheses space and to derive informative weights of clauses for the reasoner. The paper shows how to incorporate these building blocks into a scalable architecture that can parallelize all phases on a Hadoop-based distributed platform. Our experiments with the ClueWeb09 corpus include comparisons to the recent ReadTheWeb experiment. We substantially outperform these prior results in terms of recall, with the same precision, while having low run-times."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_kotov_mne/,"In this work, we study a new text mining problem of discovering named entities with temporally correlated bursts of mention counts in multiple multilingual Web news streams. Mining named entities with temporally correlated bursts of mention counts in multilingual text streams has many interesting and important applications, such as identification of the latent events, attracting the attention of on-line media in different countries, and valuable linguistic knowledge in the form of transliterations. While mining ""bursty"" terms in a single text stream has been studied before, the problem of detecting terms with temporally correlated bursts in multilingual Web streams raises two new challenges: (i) correlated terms in multiple streams may have bursts that are of different orders of magnitude in their intensity and (ii) bursts of correlated terms may be separated by time gaps. We propose a two-stage method for mining items with temporally correlated bursts from multiple data streams, which addresses both challenges. In the first stage of the method, the temporal behavior of different entities is normalized by modeling them with the Markov-Modulated Poisson Process. In the second stage, a dynamic programming algorithm is used to discover correlated bursts of different items, that can be potentially separated by time gaps. We evaluated our method with the task of discovering transliterations of named entities from multilingual Web news streams. Experimental results indicate that our method can not only effectively discover named entities with correlated bursts in multilingual Web news streams, but also outperforms two state-of-the-art baseline methods for unsupervised discovery of transliterations in static text collections."

Furthermore, we propose two dynamic ranking algorithms, both of which are computationally efficient. We prove that these algorithms provide retrieval performance that is guaranteed to be at least as good as the optimal static ranking algorithm. In empirical evaluations, dynamic ranking shows substantial improvements in retrieval performance over conventional static rankings."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_chierichetti_otd/,"Classic search engine results are presented as an ordered list of documents and the problem of presentation trivially reduces to ordering documents by their scores. This is because users scan a list presentation from top to bottom. This leads to natural list optimization measures such as the discounted cumulative gain (DCG) and the rank-biased precision (RBP). Increasingly, search engines are using two-dimensional results presentations; image and shopping search results are long-standing examples. The simplistic heuristic used in practice is to place images by row-major order in the matrix presentation. However, a variety of evidence suggests that users' scan of pages is not in this matrix order. In this paper we (1) view users' scan of a results page as a Markov chain, which yields DCG and RBP as special cases for linear lists; (2) formulate, study, and develop solutions for the problem of inferring the Markov chain from click logs; (3) from these inferred Markov chains, empirically validate folklore phenomena (e.g., the ""golden triangle"" of user scans in two dimensions); and (4) develop and experimentally compare algorithms for optimizing user utility in matrix presentations. The theory and algorithms extend naturally beyond matrix presentations."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_panigrahi_rec/,"Commerce search engines have become popular in recent years, as users increasingly search for (and buy) products on the web. In response to an user query, they surface links to products in their catalog (or index) that match the requirements specified in the query. Often, few or no product in the catalog matches the user query exactly, and the search engine is forced to return a set of products that partially match the query. This paper considers the problem of choosing a set of products in response to an user query, so as to ensure maximum user satisfaction. We call this the result enrichment problem in commerce search. The challenge in result enrichment is two-fold: the search engine needs to estimate the extent to which a user genuinely cares about an attribute that she has specified in a query; then, it must display products in the catalog that match the user requirement on the important attributes, but have a similar but possibly non-identical value on the less important ones. To this end, we propose a technique for measuring the importance of individual attribute values and the similarity between different values of an attribute. A novelty of our approach is that we use entire browse trails, rather than just clickthrough rates, in this estimation algorithm. We develop a model for this problem, propose an algorithm to solve it, and support our theoretical findings via experiments conducted on actual user data."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_tolomei_itb/,"The research challenge addressed in this paper is to devise effective techniques for identifying task-based sessions, i.e. sets of possibly non contiguous queries issued by the user of a Web Search Engine for carrying out a given task. In order to evaluate and compare different approaches, we built, by means of a manual labelling process, a ground-truth where the queries of a given query log have been grouped in tasks. Our analysis of this ground-truth shows that users tend to perform more than one task at the same time, since about 75% of the submitted queries involve a multi-tasking activity. We formally define the Task-based Session Discovery Problem (TSDP) as the problem of best approximating the manually annotated tasks, and we propose several variants of well known clustering algorithms, as well as a novel efficient heuristic algorithm, specifically tuned for solving the TSDP. These algorithms also exploit the collaborative knowledge collected by Wiktionary and Wikipedia for detecting query pairs that are not similar from a lexical content point of view, but actually semantically related. The proposed algorithms have been evaluated on the above ground-truth, and are shown to perform better than state-of-the-art approaches, because they effectively take into account the multi-tasking behavior of users."

http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_li_uoe/,"Contextual bandit algorithms have become popular for online recommendation systems such as Digg, Yahoo! Buzz, and news recommendation in general. Offline evaluation of the effectiveness of new algorithms in these applications is critical for protecting online user experiences but very challenging due to their ""partial-label"" nature. Common practice is to create a simulator which simulates the online environment for the problem at hand and then run an algorithm against this simulator. However, creating simulator itself is often difficult and modelling bias is usually unavoidably introduced. In this paper, we introduce a replay methodology for contextual bandit algorithm evaluation. Different from simulator-based approaches, our method is completely data-driven and very easy to adapt to different applications. More importantly, our method can provide provably unbiased evaluations. Our empirical results on a large-scale news article recommendation dataset collected from Yahoo!

Furthermore, comparisons between our offline replay and online bucket evaluation of several contextual bandit algorithms show accuracy and effectiveness of our offline evaluation method."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2011_lang_dam/,"We introduce and formalize a novel constrained path optimization problem that is the heart of the real-time ad serving task in the Yahoo! (formerly RightMedia) Display Advertising Exchange. In the Exchange, the ad server's task for each display opportunity is to compute, with low latency, an optimal valid path through a directed graph representing the business arrangements between the hundreds of thousands of business entities that are participating in the Exchange. These entities include not only publishers and advertisers, but also intermediate entities called ""ad networks"" which have delegated their ad serving responsibilities to the Exchange. Path optimality is determined by the payment to the publisher, and is affected by an advertiser's bid and also by the revenue-sharing agreements between the entities in the chosen path leading back to the publisher. Path validity is determined by constraints which focus on the following three issues: 1) suitability of the opportunity's web page and its publisher 2)suitability of the user who is currently viewing that web page, and 3) suitability of a candidate ad and its advertiser. Because the Exchange's constrained path optimization task is novel, there are no published algorithms for it. This paper describes two different algorithms that have both been successfully used in the actual Yahoo! ad server. The first algorithm has the advantage of being extremely simple, while the second is more robust thanks to its polynomial worst-case running time. In both cases, meeting latency caps has required that the basic algorithms be improved by optimizations; we will describe a candidate ordering scheme and a pre-computation scheme that have both been effective in reducing latency in the real ad serving system that serves over ten billion ad calls per day."

However, current document search algorithms have a static view of the document content, with only a single version of the document in the index at any point in time. In this paper, we present the first published analysis of using the temporal dynamics of document content to improve relevance ranking. We show that there is a strong relationship between the amount and frequency of content change and relevance. We develop a novel probabilistic document ranking algorithm that allows differential weighting of terms based on their temporal characteristics. By leveraging such content dynamics we show significant performance improvements for navigational queries."

In this paper, we propose a retrieval system which automatically detects and responds to recency sensitive queries. The system detects recency sensitive queries using a high precision classifier. The system responds to recency sensitive queries by using a machine learned ranking model trained for such queries. We use multiple recency features to provide temporal evidence which effectively represents document recency. Furthermore, we propose several training methodologies important for training recency sensitive rankers. Finally, we develop new evaluation metrics for recency sensitive queries. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_sarma_rmit/,"We study the problem of designing a mechanism to rank items in forums by making use of the user reviews such as thumb and star ratings. We compare mechanisms where forum users rate individual posts and also mechanisms where the user is asked to perform a pairwise comparison and state which one is better. The main metric used to evaluate a mechanism is the ranking accuracy vs the cost of reviews, where the cost is measured as the average number of reviews used per post. We show that for many reasonable probability models, there is no thumb (or star) based ranking mechanism that can produce approximately accurate rankings with bounded number of reviews per item. On the other hand we provide a review mechanism based on pairwise comparisons which achieves approximate rankings with bounded cost. We have implemented a system, shout velocity [5], which is a twitter-like forum but items (i.e., tweets in Twitter) are rated by using comparisons. For each new item the user who posts the item is required to compare two previous entries. This ensures that over a sequence of n posts, we get at least n comparisons requiring one review per item on average. Our mechanism uses this sequence of comparisons to obtain a ranking estimate. It ensures that every item is reviewed at least once and winning entries are reviewed more often to obtain better estimates of top items."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_bendersky_lci/,"Modeling query concepts through term dependencies has been shown to have a significant positive effect on retrieval performance, especially for tasks such as web search, where relevance at high ranks is particularly critical. Most previous work, however, treats all concepts as equally important, an assumption that often does not hold, especially for longer, more complex queries. In this paper, we show that one of the most effective existing term dependence models can be naturally extended by assigning weights to concepts. We demonstrate that the weighted dependence model can be trained using existing learning-to-rank techniques, even with a relatively small number of training queries. Our study compares the effectiveness of both endogenous (collection- based) and exogenous (based on external sources) features for determining concept importance. To test the weighted dependence model, we perform experiments on both publicly available TREC corpora and a proprietary web corpus. Our experimental results indicate that our model consistently and significantly outperforms both the standard bag-of-words model and the unweighted term dependence model, and that combining endogenous and exogenous features generally results in the best retrieval effectiveness."

The evaluation of these techniques has primarily, however, focused on proprietary query logs and selected samples of queries. In this paper, we suggest that anchor text, which is readily available, can be an effective substitute for a query log and study the effectiveness of a range of query reformulation techniques (including log-based stemming, substitution, and expansion) using standard TREC collections. Our results show that log- based query reformulation techniques are indeed effective with standard collections, but expansion is a much safer form of query modification than word substitution. We also show that using anchor text as a simulated query log is as least as effective as a real log for these techniques."

Until now, that premise has remained relatively unexamined. Using library data, we test the tagging approach to organizing a collection. We find that tagging systems have three major large scale organizational features: consistency, quality, and completeness. In addition to testing these features, we present results suggesting that users produce tags similar to the topics designed by experts, that paid tagging can effectively supplement tags in a tagging system, and that information integration may be possible across tagging systems."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_konig_psf/,"Query intent classification is crucial for web search and advertising. It is known to be challenging because web queries contain less than three words on average, and so provide little signal to base classification decisions on. At the same time, the vocabulary used in search queries is vast: thus, classifiers based on word-occurrence have to deal with a very sparse feature space, and often require large amounts of training data. Prior efforts to address the issue of feature sparseness augmented the feature space using features computed from the results obtained by issuing the query to be classified against a web search engine. However, these approaches induce high latency, making them unacceptable in practice. In this paper, we propose a new class of features that realizes the benefit of search-based features without high latency. These leverage co-occurrence between the query keywords and tags applied to documents in search results, resulting in a significant boost to web query classification accuracy. By precomputing the tag incidence for a suitably chosen set of keyword-combinations, we are able to generate the features online with low latency and memory requirements. We evaluate the accuracy of our approach using a large corpus of real web queries in the context of commercial search."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_wetzker_ityt/,"Collaborative tagging services (folksonomies) have been among the stars of the Web 2.0 era. They allow their users to label diverse resources with freely chosen keywords (tags). Our studies of two real-world folksonomies unveil that individual users develop highly personalized vocabularies of tags. While these meet individual needs and preferences, the considerable differences between personal tag vocabularies (personomies) impede services such as social search or customized tag recommendation. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-centric tag model that allows us to derive mappings between personal tag vocabularies and the corresponding folksonomies. Using these mappings, we can infer the meaning of user-assigned tags and can predict choices of tags a user may want to assign to new items. Furthermore, our translational approach helps in reducing common problems related to tag ambiguity, synonymous tags, or multilingualism. We evaluate the applicability of our method in tag recommendation and tag-based social search. Extensive experiments show that our translational model improves the prediction accuracy in both scenarios."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_rendle_pit/,"Tagging plays an important role in many recent websites. Recommender systems can help to suggest a user the tags he might want to use for tagging a specific item. Factorization models based on the Tucker Decomposition (TD) model have been shown to provide high quality tag recommendations outperforming other approaches like PageRank, FolkRank, collaborative filtering, etc. The problem with TD models is the cubic core tensor resulting in a cubic runtime in the factorization dimension for prediction and learning. In this paper, we present the factorization model PITF (Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization) which is a special case of the TD model with linear runtime both for learning and prediction. PITF explicitly models the pairwise interactions between users, items and tags. The model is learned with an adaption of the Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) criterion which originally has been introduced for item recommendation. Empirically, we show on real world datasets that this model outperforms TD largely in run- time and even can achieve better prediction quality. Besides our lab experiments, PITF has also won the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for graph-based tag recommendation."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_chen_fmftl/,"We propose fLDA, a novel matrix factorization method to predict ratings in recommender system applications where a “bag-of-words” representation for item meta-data is natu- ral. Such scenarios are commonplace in web applications like content recommendation, ad targeting and web search where items are articles, ads and web pages respectively. Because of data sparseness, regularization is key to good predictive accuracy. Our method works by regularizing both user and item factors simultaneously through user features and the bag of words associated with each item. Specifically, each word in an item is associated with a discrete latent factor often referred to as the topic of the word; item topics are obtained by averaging topics across all words in an item. Then, user rating on an item is modeled as user’s affinity to the item’s topics where user affinity to topics (user factors) and topic assignments to words in items (item factors) are learned jointly in a supervised fashion. To avoid overfitting, user and item factors are regularized through Gaussian linear regression and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) priors respectively. We show our model is accurate, interpretable and handles both cold-start and warm-start scenarios seamlessly through a single model. The efficacy of our method is illustrated on benchmark datasets and a new dataset from Yahoo! Buzz where fLDA provides superior predictive accuracy in cold-start scenarios and is comparable to state-of- the-art methods in warm-start scenarios. As a by-product, fLDA also identifies interesting topics that explains user- item interactions. Our method also generalizes a recently proposed technique called supervised LDA (sLDA) to col- laborative filtering applications. While sLDA estimates item topic vectors in a supervised fashion for a single regression, fLDA incorporates multiple regressions (one for each user) in estimating the item factors."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_carlson_cssl/,"We consider the problem of semi-supervised learning to extract categories (e.g., academic fields, athletes) and relations (e.g., PlaysSport (athlete, sport)) from web pages, starting with a handful of labeled training examples of each category or relation, plus hundreds of millions of unlabeled web documents. Semi-supervised training using only a few labeled examples is typically unreliable because the learning task is underconstrained. This paper pursues the thesis that much greater accuracy can be achieved by further constraining the learning task, by coupling the semi-supervised training of many extractors for different categories and relations. We characterize several ways in which the training of category and relation extractors can be coupled, and present experimental results demonstrating significantly improved accuracy as a result."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_zhou_docq/,"As the Web provides rich data embedded in the immense contents inside pages, we witness many ad-hoc efforts for exploiting fine granularity information across Web text, such as Web information extraction, typed-entity search, and question answering. To unify and generalize these efforts, this paper proposes a general search system - Data-oriented Content Query System (DoCQS) - to search directly into document contents for finding relevant values of desired data types. Motivated by the current limitations, we start by distilling the essential capabilities needed by such content querying. The capabilities call for a conceptually relational model, upon which we design a powerful Content Query Language (CQL). For efficient processing, we design novel index structures and query processing algorithms. We evaluate our proposal over two concrete domains of realistic Web corpora, demonstrating that our query language is rather flexible and expressive, and our query processing is efficient with reasonable index overhead."

Negative facts in the views may come, e.g., from functional dependencies in the underlying database schema. We want to predict the truth values of the facts. Beyond simple methods such as voting (typically rather accurate), we explore techniques based on “corroboration”, i.e., taking into account trust in the views. We introduce three fix-point algorithms corresponding to different levels of complexity of an underlying probabilistic model. They all estimate both truth values of facts and trust in the views. We present experimental studies on synthetic and real-world data. This analysis illustrates how and in which context these methods improve corroboration results over baseline methods. We believe that corroboration can serve in a wide range of applications such as source selection in the semantic Web, data quality assessment or semantic annotation cleaning in social networks. This work sets the bases for a wide range of techniques for solving these more complex problems."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_bian_rwqd/,"Queries describe the users’ search intent and therefore they play an essential role in the context of ranking for information retrieval and Web search. However, most of existing approaches for ranking do not explicitly take into consideration the fact that queries vary significantly along several dimensions and entail different treatments regarding the ranking models.  In this paper, we propose to incorporate query difference into ranking by introducing query-dependent loss functions. In the context of Web search, query difference is usually represented as different query categories; and, queries are usually classified according to search intent such as navigational, informational and transactional queries. Based on the observation that such kind of query categorization has high correlation with the user’s different expectation on the result accuracy on different rank positions, we develop position-sensitive query-dependent loss functions exploring such kind of query categorization. Beyond the simple learning method that builds ranking functions with predefined query categorization, we further propose a new method that learns both ranking functions and query categorization simultaneously.  We apply the query dependent loss functions to two particular ranking algorithms, RankNet and ListMLE. Experimental results demonstrate that query-dependent loss functions can be exploited to significantly improve the accuracy of learned ranking functions. We also show that the ranking function jointly learned with query categorization can achieve better performance than that learned with predefined query categorization. Finally, we provide analysis and conduct additional experiments to gain deeper understanding on the advantages of ranking with query-dependent loss functions over other query-dependent ranking approaches and query-independent approaches."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_moon_irir/,"Ranking a set of retrieved documents according to their relevance to a given query has become a popular problem at the intersection of web search, machine learning, and information retrieval. Recent work on ranking focused on a number of different paradigms, namely, pointwise, pairwise, and list-wise approaches. Each of those paradigms focuses on a different aspect of the dataset while largely ignoring others. The current paper shows how a combination of them can lead to improved ranking performance and, moreover, how it can be implemented in log-linear time. The basic idea of the algorithm is to use isotonic regression with adaptive bandwidth selection per relevance grade. This results in an implicitly-defined loss function which can be minimized efficiently by a subgradient descent procedure. Experimental results show that the resulting algorithm is competitive on both commercial search engine data and publicly available LETOR data sets."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_castillo_apf/,"Query recommendation is an integral part of modern search engines. The goal of query recommendation is to facilitate users while searching for information. Query recommendation also allows users to explore concepts related to their information needs. In this paper, we present a formal treatment of the problem of query recommendation. In our framework we model the querying behavior of users by a probabilistic reformulation graph, or query-flow graph [Boldi et al. CIKM 2008]. A sequence of queries submitted by a user can be seen as a path on this graph. Assigning score values to queries allows us to define suitable utility functions and to consider the expected utility achieved by a reformulation path on the query-flow graph. Providing recommendations can be seen as adding shortcuts in the query-flow graph that “nudge” the reformulation paths of users, in such a way that users are more likely to follow paths with larger expected utility. We discuss in detail the most important questions that arise in the proposed framework. In particular, we provide examples of meaningful utility functions to optimize, we discuss how to estimate the effect of recommendations on the reformulation probabilities, we address the complexity of the optimization problems that we consider, we suggest efficient algorithmic solutions, and we validate our models and algorithms with extensive experimentation. Our techniques can be applied to other scenarios where user behavior can be modeled as a Markov process."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_li_iqot/,"In information retrieval, relevance of documents with respect to queries is usually judged by humans, and used in evaluation and/or learning of ranking functions. Previous work has shown that certain level of noise in relevance judgments has little effect on evaluation, especially for comparison purposes. Recently learning to rank has become one of the major means to create ranking models in which the models are automatically learned from the data derived from a large number of relevance judgments. As far as we know, there was no previous work about quality of training data for learning to rank, and this paper tries to study the issue. Specifically, we address three problems. Firstly, we show that the quality of training data labeled by humans has critical impact on the performance of learning to rank algorithms. Secondly, we propose detecting relevance judgment errors using click-through data accumulated at a search engine. Two discriminative models, referred to as sequential dependency model and full dependency model, are proposed to make the detection. Both models consider the conditional dependency of relevance labels and thus are more powerful than the conditionally independent model previously proposed for other tasks. Finally, we verify that using training data in which the errors are detected and corrected by our method, we can improve the performance of learning to rank algorithms."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_dupret_amtei/,"We propose a new model to interpret the click through logs of a web search engine. This model is based on explicit assumptions on the user behavior. In particular, we draw conclusions on a document relevance by observing the user behavior after he examined the document and not based on whether a user clicks or not a document url. This results in a model based on intrinsic relevance, as opposed to perceived relevance. We use the model to predict document relevance and then use this as feature for a “Learning to Rank” machine learning algorithm. Comparing the ranking functions obtained by training the algorithm with and without the new feature we observe surprisingly good results. This is particularly notable given that the baseline we use is the heavily optimized ranking function of a leading commercial search engine. A deeper analysis shows that the new feature is particularly helpful for non navigational queries and queries with a large abandonment rate or a large average number of queries per session. This is important because these types of query is considered to be the most difficult to solve."

Our model-based framework GeoFolk combines these two aspects in order to construct better algorithms for content management, retrieval, and sharing. The approach is based on multi-modal Bayesian models which allow us to integrate spatial semantics of social media in a well-formed, probabilistic manner. We systematically evaluate the solution on a subset of Flickr data, in characteristic scenarios of tag recommendation, content classification, and clustering. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baseline techniques that are based on one of the aspects alone. The approach described in this contribution can also be used in other domains such as Geoweb retrieval."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_goyal_lip/,"Recently, there has been tremendous interest in the phenomenon of influence propagation in social networks. The studies in this area assume they have as input to their problems a social graph with edges labeled with probabilities of influence between users. However, the question of where these probabilities come from or how they can be computed from real social network data has been largely ignored until now. Thus it is interesting to ask whether from a social graph and a log of actions by its users, one can build models of influence. This is the main problem attacked in this paper. In addition to proposing models and algorithms for learning the model parameters and for testing the learned models to make predictions, we also develop techniques for predicting the time by which a user may be expected to perform an action. We validate our ideas and techniques using the Flickr data set consisting of a social graph with 1.3M nodes, 40M edges, and an action log consisting of 35M tuples referring to 300K distinct actions. Beyond showing that there is genuine influence happening in a real social network, we show that our techniques have excellent prediction performance."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_mislove_yawyk/,"Online social networks are now a popular way for users to connect, express themselves, and share content. Users in today’s online social networks often post a profile, consisting of attributes like geographic location, interests, and schools attended. Such profile information is used on the sites as a basis for grouping users, for sharing content, and for suggesting users who may benefit from interaction. However, in practice, not all users provide these attributes. In this paper, we ask the question: given attributes for some fraction of the users in an online social network, can we infer the attributes of the remaining users? In other words, can the attributes of users, in combination with the social network graph, be used to predict the attributes of another user in the network? To answer this question, we gather fine-grained data from two social networks and try to infer user profile attributes. We find that users with common attributes are more likely to be friends and often form dense communities, and we propose a method of inferring user attributes that is inspired by previous approaches to detecting communities in social networks. Our results show that certain user attributes can be inferred with high accuracy when given information on as little as 20% of the users."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_weng_trft/,"This paper focuses on the problem of identifying influential users of micro-blogging services. Twitter, one of the most notable micro-blogging services, employs a social-networking model called “following”, in which each user can choose who she wants to “follow” to receive tweets from without requiring the latter to give permission first. In a dataset prepared for this study, it is observed that (1) 72.4% of the users in Twitter follow more than 80% of their followers, and (2) 80.5% of the users have 80% of users they are following follow them back. Our study reveals that the presence of “reciprocity” can be explained by phenomenon of homophily [14]. Based on this finding, TwitterRank, an extension of PageRank algorithm, is proposed to measure the influence of users in Twitter. TwitterRank measures the influence taking both the topical similarity between users and the link structure into account. Experimental results show that TwitterRank outperforms the one Twitter currently uses and other related algorithms, including the original PageRank and Topic-sensitive PageRank."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_menczer_fif/,"Web 2.0 applications have attracted a considerable amount of attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create light-weight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and semantic components of social media has been only partially explored. Here we focus on Flickr and Last.fm, two social media systems in which we can relate the tagging activity of the users with an explicit representation of their social network. We show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local alignment between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar topical interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore semantic similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on the Last.fm data set, confirming that the social network constructed from semantic similarity captures actual friendship more accurately than Last.fm’s suggestions based on listening patterns."

http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_zervas_awdf/,"Attributing a dollar value to a keyword is an essential part of running any profitable search engine advertising campaign. When an advertiser has complete control over the interaction with and monetization of each user arriving on a given keyword, the value of that term can be accurately tracked. However, in many instances, the advertiser may monetize arrivals indirectly through one or more third parties. In such cases, it is typical for the third party to provide only coarse-grained reporting: rather than report each monetization event, users are aggregated into larger channels and the third party reports aggregate information such as total daily revenue for each channel. Examples of third parties that use channels include Amazon and Google AdSense. In such scenarios, the number of channels is generally much smaller than the number of keywords whose value per click (VPC) we wish to learn. However, the advertiser has flexibility as to how to assign keywords to channels over time. We introduce the channelization problem: how do we adaptively assign keywords to channels over the course of multiple days to quickly obtain accurate VPC estimates of all keywords? We relate this problem to classical results in weighing design, devise new adaptive algorithms for this problem, and quantify the performance of these algorithms experimentally. Our results demonstrate that adaptive weighing designs that exploit statistics of term frequency, variability in VPCs across keywords, and flexible channel assignments over time provide the best estimators of keyword VPCs."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_pang_agobp/,"One of the most prevalent online advertising methods is textual advertising. To produce a textual ad, an advertiser must craft a short creative (the text of the ad) linking to a landing page, which describes the product or service being promoted. Furthermore, the advertiser must associate the creative to a set of manually chosen bid phrases representing those Web search queries that should trigger the ad. For efficiency, given a landing page, the bid phrases are often chosen first, and then for each bid phrase the creative is produced using a template. Nevertheless, an ad campaign (e.g., for a large retailer) might involve thousands of landing pages and tens or hundreds of thousands of bid phrases, hence the entire process is very laborious. Our study aims towards the automatic construction of online ad campaigns: given a landing page, we propose several algorithmic methods to generate bid phrases suitable for the given input. Such phrases must be both relevant (that is, reflect the content of the page) and well-formed (that is, likely to be used as queries to a Web search engine). To this end, we use a two phase approach. First, candidate bid phrases are generated by a number of methods, including a (monolingual) translation model capable of generating phrases not contained within the text of the input as well as previously ""unseen"" phrases. Second, the candidates are ranked in a probabilistic framework using both the translation model, which favors relevant phrases, as well as a bid phrase language model, which favors well-formed phrases. Empirical evaluation based on a real-life corpus of advertiser-created landing pages and associated bid phrases confirms the value of our approach, which successfully re-generates many of the human-crafted bid phrases and performs significantly better than a pure text extraction method."

Predicting the probability that users click on ads is crucial to sponsored search because the prediction is used to influence ranking, filtering, placement, and pricing of ads.

Pricing impacts the advertisers’ return on their investment and revenue for the search engine. The objective of this paper is to present a framework for the personalization of click models in sponsored search. We develop user-specific and demographic-based features that reflect the click behavior of individuals and groups. The features are based on observations of search and click behaviors of a large number of users of a commercial search engine.

http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_hassan_bdub/,"Web search engines are traditionally evaluated in terms of the relevance of web pages to individual queries. However, relevance of web pages does not tell the complete picture, since an individual query may represent only a piece of the user’s information need and users may have different information needs underlying the same queries. We address the problem of predicting user search goal success by modeling user behavior. We show empirically that user behavior alone can give an accurate picture of the success of the user’s web search goals, without considering the relevance of the documents displayed. In fact, our experiments show that models using user behavior are more predictive of goal success than those using document relevance. We build novel sequence models incorporating time distributions for this task and our experiments show that the sequence and time distribution models are more accurate than static models based on user behavior, or predictions based on document relevance."

We propose two methods for quantifying the reusability of a test collection for evaluating new systems. The proposed methods provide simple yet highly effective tests for determining whether an existing set of judgments is useful for evaluating a new system.

By automatically identifying these events and their associated user-contributed social media documents, which is the focus of this paper, we can enable event browsing and search in state-of-the-art search engines. To address this problem, we exploit the rich “context” associated with social media con- tent, including user-provided annotations (e.g., title, tags) and automatically generated information (e.g., content creation time). Using this rich context, which includes both textual and non-textual features, we can define appropriate document similarity metrics to enable online clustering of media to events. As a key contribution of this paper, we explore a variety of techniques for learning multi-feature similarity metrics for social media documents in a principled manner. We evaluate our techniques on large-scale, real- world datasets of event images from Flickr.

Many Web applications use simple compression algorithms— e.g. gzip, or word-based Move-to-Front or Huffman coders— and conclude that, even compressed, raw data take more space than Inverted Lists. In this paper we investigate two typical scenarios of use of data compression for large Web collections. In the first scenario, the compressed pages are stored on disk and we only need to support the fast scanning of large parts of the com- pressed collection (such as for map-reduce paradigms). In the second scenario, we consider the fast access to individual pages of the compressed collection that is distributed among the RAMs of many PCs (such as for search engines and miners). For the first scenario, we provide a thorough experimental comparison among state-of-the-art compressors thus indicating pros and cons of the available solutions. For the second scenario, we compare compressed-storage solutions with the new technology of compressed self-indexes. Our results show that Web pages are more compressible than expected and, consequently, that some common beliefs in this area should be reconsidered. Our results are novel for the large spectrum of tested approaches and the size of datasets, and provide a threefold contribution: a non- trivial baseline for designing new compressed-storage solutions, a guide for software developers faced with Web-page storage, and a natural complement to the recent figures on InvertedList-compression."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_yan_rgsi/,"There has been a large amount of research on efficient document retrieval in both IR and web search areas. One important technique to improve retrieval efficiency is early termination, which speeds up query processing by avoiding scanning the entire inverted lists. Most early termination techniques first build new inverted indexes by sorting the inverted lists in the order of either the term-dependent information, e.g., term frequencies or term IR scores, or the term-independent information, e.g., static rank of the document; and then apply appropriate retrieval strategies on the resulting indexes. Although the methods based only on the static rank have been shown to be ineffective for the early termination, there are still many advantages of using the methods based on term-independent information. In this paper, we propose new techniques to organize inverted indexes based on the term- independent information beyond static rank and study the new retrieval strategies on the resulting indexes. We perform a detailed experimental evaluation on our new techniques and compare them with the existing approaches. Our results on the TREC GOV and GOV2 data sets show that our techniques can improve query efficiency significantly."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_cambazoglu_eeo/,"Some commercial web search engines rely on sophisticated machine learning systems for ranking web documents. Due to very large collection sizes and tight constraints on query response times, online efficiency of these learning systems forms a bottleneck. An important problem in such systems is to speedup the ranking process without sacrificing much from the quality of results. In this paper, we propose optimization strategies that allow short-circuiting score computations in additive learning systems. The strategies are evaluated over a state-of-the-art machine learning system and a large, real-life query log, obtained from Yahoo!. By the proposed strategies, we are able to speedup the score computations by more than four times with almost no loss in result quality."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_sarma_asbd/,"We study the fundamental problem of computing distances between nodes in large graphs such as the web graph and social networks. Our objective is to be able to answer distance queries between pairs of nodes in real time. Since the standard shortest path algorithms are expensive, our approach moves the time-consuming shortest-path computation offline, and at query time only looks up precomputed values and performs simple and fast computations on these precomputed values. More specifically, during the offline phase we compute and store a small “sketch” for each node in the graph, and at query-time we look up the sketches of the source and destination nodes and perform a simple computation using these two sketches to estimate the distance."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm2010_kohlschutter_bdu/,"In addition to the actual content Web pages consist of navigational elements, templates, and advertisements. This boilerplate text typically is not related to the main content, may deteriorate search precision and thus needs to be detected properly. In this paper, we analyze a small set of shallow text features for classifying the individual text elements in a Web page. We compare the approach to complex, state- of-the-art techniques and show that competitive accuracy can be achieved, at almost no cost. Moreover, we derive a simple and plausible stochastic model for describing the boilerplate creation process. With the help of our model, we also quantify the impact of boilerplate removal to retrieval performance and show significant improvements over the baseline. Finally, we extend the principled approach by straight-forward heuristics, achieving a remarkable accuracy."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm09_dean_cblirs/,"Building and operating large-scale information retrieval systems used by hundreds of millions of people around the world provides a number of interesting challenges. Designing such systems requires making complex design tradeoffs in a number of dimensions, including (a) the number of user queries that must be handled per second and the response latency to these requests, (b) the number and size of various corpora that are searched, (c) the latency and frequency with which documents are updated or added to the corpora, and (d) the quality and cost of the ranking algorithms that are used for retrieval. In this talk I'll discuss the evolution of Google's hardware infrastructure and information retrieval systems and some of the design challenges that arise from ever-increasing demands in all of these dimensions. I'll also describe how we use various pieces of distributed systems infrastructure when building these retrieval systems. Finally, I'll describe some future challenges and open research problems in this area."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm09_weikum_hsrnw/,"There are major trends to advance the functionality of search engines to a more expressive semantic level. This is enabled by employing large-scale information extraction of entities and relationships from semistructured as well as natural-language Web sources. In addition, harnessing Semantic-Web-style ontologies and reaching into Deep-Web sources can contribute towards a grand vision of turning the Web into a comprehensive knowledge base that can be efficiently searched with high precision. This talk presents ongoing research towards this objective, with emphasis on our work on the YAGO knowledge base and the NAGA search engine but also covering related projects. YAGO is a large collection of entities and relational facts that are harvested from Wikipedia and WordNet with high accuracy and reconciled into a consistent RDF-style ""semantic"" graph. For further growing YAGO from Web sources while retaining its high quality, pattern-based extraction is combined with logic-based consistency checking in a unified framework. NAGA provides graph-template-based search over this data, with powerful ranking capabilities based on a statistical language model for graphs. Advanced queries and the need for ranking approximate matches pose efficiency and scalability challenges that are addressed by algorithmic and indexing techniques. YAGO is publicly available and has been imported into various other knowledge-management projects including DBpedia. YAGO shares many of its goals and methodologies with parallel projects along related lines. These include Avatar, Cimple/DBlife, DBpedia, KnowItAll/TextRunner, Kylin/KOG, and the Libra technology (and more). Together they form an exciting trend towards providing comprehensive knowledge bases with semantic search capabilities."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm09_liu_ubgsea/,"This paper focuses on ‘user browsing graph’ which is constructed with users’ click-through behavior modeled with Web access logs. User browsing graph has recently been adopted to improve Web search performance and the initial study shows it is more reliable than hyperlink graph for inferring page importance. However, structure and evolution of the user browsing graph haven’t been fully studied and many questions remain to be answered. In this paper, we look into the structure of the user browsing graph and its evolution over time. We try to give a quantitative analysis on the difference in graph structure between hyperlink graph and user browsing graph, and then find out why link analysis algorithms perform better on the browsing graph. We also propose a method for combining user behavior information into hyper link graph. Experimental results show that user browsing graph and hyperlink graph share few links in common and a combination of these two graphs can gain good performance in quality estimation of pages."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm09_goncalves_rwwl/,"Analysis of aggregate Web traffic has shown that PageRank is a poor model of how people actually navigate the Web. Using the empirical traffic patterns generated by a thousand users over the course of two months, we characterize the properties of Web traffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models, in which destinations are independent of past decisions. In particular, we show that the diversity of sites visited by individual users is smaller and more broadly distributed than predicted by the PageRank model; that link traffic is more broadly distributed than predicted; and that the time between consecutive visits to the same site by a user is less broadly distributed than predicted. To account for these discrepancies, we introduce a more realistic navigation model in which agents maintain individual lists of bookmarks that are used as teleportation targets. The model can also account for branching, a traffic property caused by browser features such as tabs and the back button. The model reproduces aggregate traffic patterns such as site popularity, while also generating more accurate predictions of diversity, link traffic, and return time distributions. This model for the first time allows us to capture the extreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements while explaining the more narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm09_arikan_twt/,"Temporal expressions, such as between 1992 and 2000, are frequent across many kinds of documents. Text retrieval, though, treats them as common terms, thus ignoring their inherent semantics. For queries with a strong temporal component, such as U.S. president 1997, this leads to a decrease in retrieval effectiveness, since relevant documents (e.g., a biography of Bill Clinton containing the aforementioned temporal expression) can not be reliably matched to the query. We propose a novel approach, based on language models, to make temporal expressions first-class citizens of the retrieval model. In addition, we present experiments that show actual improvements in retrieval effectiveness."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm09_heymann_ccvt/,"Social cataloging sites—tagging systems where users tag books—provide us with a rare opportunity to contrast tags to other information organization systems. We contrast tags to a controlled vocabulary, the Library of Congress Subject Headings, which has been developed over several decades. We find that many of the keywords designated by tags and LCSH are similar or the same, but that usage of keywords by annotators is quite different."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm09_sun_sccst/,"Most studies on tags focus on collaborative tagging systems where each resource (e.g., article, photo) can be tagged by multiple users with multiple tags. The tag usage patterns in self-tagging systems where a resource (e.g., a blog post) can only be tagged by its owner, however, have not been well studied. From the tags assigned by bloggers to their own blog posts, we obtain interesting insights on tag distribution stability and tag clarity. We further discuss the meaning of tag co-occurrences in the context of blogs and argue that tag networks based on co-occurrence from self-tagging system needs to be interpreted differently than that in collaborative tagging systems."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm09_antonellis_twq/,"Web search queries capture the information need of search engine users. Search engines store these queries in their logs and analyze them to guide their search results. In this work, we argue that not only a search engine can benefit from data stored in these logs, but also the web users. We first show how clickthrough logs can be collected in a distributed fashion using the http referer field in web server access logs. We then perform a set of experiments to study the information value of search engine queries when treated as ""tags"" or ""labels"" for the web pages that both appear as a result and the user actually clicks on. We ask how much extra information these query tags provide for web pages by comparing them to tags from the del.icio.us bookmarking site and to the pagetext. We find that query tags can provide substantially many (on average 250 tags per URL), new tags (on average 125 tags per URL are not present in the pagetext) for a large fraction of the Web."
http://videolectures.net/wsdm08_najork_weint/,"WSDM (pronounced “wisdom”) is a brand new ACM conference intended to be complementary to the World Wide Web Conference tracks in search and data mining. The pace of innovation in these areas has reached a level that requires more than one premier annual venue. Specifically, substantial work is currently being done in the areas of workload-driven crawling and monitoring, security and privacy, user profiling, personalized search and ranking, Web advertising, social media analysis, and spam detection. WSDM was first conceived in early 2006, and made reality by the efforts of many members of the search and data mining community. The conference owes a special debt of gratitude to Ziv Bar -Yossef, who nurtured the conference from conception to realization."

http://videolectures.net/wsdm08_heymann_csbiws/,"Social bookmarking is a recent phenomenon which has the potential to give us a great deal of data about pages on the web. One major question is whether that data can be used to augment systems like web search. To answer this question, over the past year we have gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yet analyzed by academic researchers. Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarks from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us. We contribute a characterization of posts to del.icio.us: how many bookmarks exist (about 115 million), how fast is it growing, and how active are the URLs being posted about (quite active). We also contribute a characterization of tags used by bookmarkers. We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certain domains, and vice versa. We also found that tags occur in over 50 percent of the pages that they annotate, and in only 20 percent of cases do they not occur in the page text, backlink page text, or forward link page text of the pages they annotate. We conclude that social bookmarking can provide search data not currently provided by other sources, though it may currently lack the size and distribution of tags necessary to make a significant impact."
