These providers can be the actual resource creators or re-distributors that redirect the user to the actual provider. In recent work, we developed a recommendation engine which provides content-based recommendations from multiple resource providers, enabling the users to navigate between the providers and their resources. In this paper, we investigate the users’ choice on the recommended items focusing on the cross-site user learning activities. The results show that the users tend to stay on the same website and not choose the first item in the recommendation list."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_torkar_stock_price_forecasting/,"This paper aims at assessing the performance of the transfer learning task consisting of training set of classiffiers on high frequency financial news data for 74 publicly traded companies, with domain speciffic labels. This source of data is provided by the Jozef Stefan Institute and is used exclusively for the purposes of this research. The trained classiffiers are then used to attribute labels to an unlabelled source of high frequency aggregated news, Event-Registry. The aim is for the relabelled data to be used in the generation of exogenous features for use in time series forecasting of the companies' prices. It is found that using a fine-tuned BERT [1] model yields the most semantically coherent labels, and the features generated from the newly labelled data prove to yield the highest accuracy forecasts on held out price data."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_bizjak_latent_distance_graphs/,"Network analysis is one of the main topics in modern data analysis, since it enables us to reason about systems by studying their inner relations, for example we can study a network by analyzing its edges. However, in many cases it is impossible to detect or measure the network directly, due to noisy data for example. We present a method for dealing with such systems, more concretely we present a probabilistic model called latent distance network, which we use to model news data from EventRegistry. In the end of the article we also present experimental results on predictions of latent distance model with methods of machine learning"
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_kenda_feature_selection/,Applying machine learning to Big Data can be a cumbersome task which requires a lot of computational power and memory. In this paper we present a feature selection technique for land-cover classiffication in earth observation scenario. The technique extends the state-of-the-art feature extractors by pruning the dimensionality of the required feature space and can achieve almost optimal results with 10-fold reduction of the number of features. The approach utilizes a genetic algorithm for generation of optimal feature vector candidates and multi-objective optimization techniques for candidate selection.
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_cerin_satellite_images/,"The weather is one of the main factors for events that happen on the surface of the earth. Surprisingly, no effort was made to use weather features together with satellite images for land cover classiffication. In the paper, we use temperature data along with satellite images to improve the accuracy of the classiffication and to get classiffication as early in the year as possible. Every year has different conditions, so the temperature can be used as an objective criterion at what time to do classiffication."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_costa_analysis_of_influenza/,"The need for appropriate, robust and efficient epidemic intelligence tools is increasing in this age of a connected society. Global health initiatives, such as Influenzanet, potentially have a central role in the future of Public Health. This paper presents the contributions to the Influenzanet initiative, describing a new monitoring system for local hubs and their data sources, based on Elasticsearch. It is often the case that the exploration of internally generated data is prioritised by national public health institutions, and therefore cannot be addressed in the global Influenzanet platform. This platform can be used by health professionals without programming expertise to encourage and enhance their independence from busy in-house IT departments and further contribute to the effectiveness of their own research. The most meaningful data visualization modules can then be considered for integration into the full Influenzanet platform that will serve the complete network, thus collaborating at a global level. With this approach we also show the importance that an active hub in carrying out its own investigations towards its own priorities. In that regard and as an example, we also describe new results on the application of state-of-the-art approaches to a local data set, using the Portuguese ILI seasons between 2005 and 2013. This study is based on the application of the Streamstory approach. It aims to show the potential of this versatile approach in: (i) identifying data-driven ILI seasons; (ii) relating the ILI incidence to the dimensions of weather data; and (iii) comparing the incidence throughout four different ILI definitions."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_mattiev_class_association/,"Associative classification (AC) is a data mining approach that combines classification and association rule mining to build classification models (classifiers). Experimental results show that in average the CBA-based approaches could achieve higher accuracy than some of the traditional classification methods. In this paper, we focus on associative classification, where class association rules are generated and analyzed to build a simple, compact, understandable and relatively accurate classifier. Furthermore, we discuss how overall coverage and average rule coverage of such classifiers affect their classification accuracy. We compare our method that uses constrained exhaustive search with some “classical” classification rule learning algorithm that uses greedy heuristic search on accuracy in some “real-life” datasets. We have performed experiments on 11 datasets from UCI Machine Learning Database Repository. Experimental evaluation shows that with decreasing overall coverage our proposed method tends to get slightly worse classification accuracy than the “classical” classification rule learning algorithms. Otherwise, the accuracy is similar or on some datasets even better than Naive Bayes and C4.5. On the other hand, the average rule coverage of our proposed method seems to have no effect on classification accuracy."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_massri_legal_domain_documents/,"In text mining document enrichment processes are used to improve information retrieval. Document enrichment helps us extract metadata from the text which can then be used in document classiffication. This paper presents the legal domain document enrichment process and analysis of the enriched data. The process of enriching the documents with multiple layers of annotations is described. The focus is on legal domain documents data set, but the proposed procedure can be generalized to any type of documents."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_mladenic_grobelnik_next_big_thing/,"This paper presents an approach to predicting the future development of scientific research based on scientific publications from the past two centuries. We have applied machine learning methods on the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset of scientific publications. Our experimental results show that the best performance is obtained for a noticeable increase of the topic frequency in the last 5 years compared to the previous 10 years. In this case, our model achieves precision of 74.3, recall of 71.7 and F1 of 73.0. Some topics that our model identified as promising are: proton proton collisions, higgs boson, quark, hadron, mobile augmented reality, variable quantum, molecular dynamics simulations, hadronic final states, search for dark matter"
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_urbancic_environmental_legal_documents/,"Finding similar documents in a big document corpus based on context has many practical applications especially in the legal sector. In this paper, our focus is on the documents related to environmental law which have been collected in a database of approximately 300k documents. We analyzed the performance of different representation models (called document embeddings) on our database and found that evaluating the results is difficult, due to the size of the database. The approaches presented can be applicable for other text datasets."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_kavsek_mobility_data/,"Today we are used to being interconnected via our smartphones and having our phone location tracked by different apps. ICT technology enables real-time monitoring and processing the user location data from GPS coordinates of a phone. Based on observing the user mobility, Artificial Intelligence methods can be used to improve transportation, proactively provide mobility recommendations and acquire knowledge using the user context. This paper describes the application of machine learning algorithms on user mobility data to identify and understand potentially interesting events. The data for this research was collected from a sample of users consenting to be monitored through our in-house developed smart phone app. A pilot study that includes 227 users that were tracked over a period of 7 years yields fairly positive evaluation results in terms of predictive accuracy of identified events but succeeds in identifying exclusively “well-known” events related to users going to or coming from the office and/or lunch. This shows that machine learning methods can be a suitable choice for identifying events in mobility data but there is still room for improvement."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_costa_health_news_bias/,"The impact of health-related news in today’s society is increasing as is the awareness of the globalization of the worlds’ habits and threats, and the impact on the continuous pursuit of a better quality of life. The risk of news media bias and the consequences it might have in the population is of great concern for public health, as are the available resources to identify the bias and further explore the news stories. In this paper we discuss several aspects, angles and perspectives on news media bias in the health domain, with a particular focus on digital epidemiology. We also present decision support tools developed to support decision makers in these explorations in the context of the MIDAS project, leveraging Big Data analytics to support decision making in public health. The presented resources provide health professionals with a global perspective on the worldwide news coverage of monitored health topics (such as, e.g., infectious diseases, mental health or childhood obesity), together with a workflow of tools allowing them to explore potential bias. Moreover, we discuss the specific challenges of news bias in the health domain, analyzing some typical examples, and using the Event Registry technology to further explore them. The exploration potential of the latter, in the health domain, is enhanced with the integration of an automated classifier based on MeSH Headings that allows researchers to explore the news using a similar workflow to that of exploring biomedical research in PubMed."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_rozanec_multiple_sources/,"Demand is the amount of certain product required by buyers at a point in time. Demand forecasting tries to predict future demand based on available information. It is considered a key component of each manufacturing company since improvements on it translate directly to resources planning, stocks and overall operations. In the context of Industry 4.0, industry digitalization provides an everincreasing number of data sources which can be consumed to gain visibility over all operations and used to optimize different processes within it. This also opens new possibilities into the field of demand forecasting, where multiple data sources can be integrated to get timely data for accurate forecasts. We describe an efficient approach for demand forecasting for discrete components B2B industry. The proposed approach provides as good or better forecasts as logisticians for most months in six months period and achieves savings considering all test months period"
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2019_kojanec_seizure_detection/,"One third of all epileptic patients is resistant to medical treatment. The construction of machines, that would detect an imminent epileptic attack based on EEG signals, represents an efficient alternative, that would help to increase their quality of life. In this article we described the implementation of an automatic detection method, based on the signal of different frequency sub-bands, using topographic maps and deep learning techniques. We constructed an ensemble of five convolutional neural networks, to classify samples of each sub-band and chose the final decision by a majority voting. The ensemble obtained 99.20% accuracy, 96.48% sensitivity and 99.27% specificity when detecting seizures of one patient. Moreover, when the networks were trained with samples taken randomly from the inter-ictal intervals, we identified on 18 of 21 seizures some false positive classifications close to the seizure onset, thus anticipating the detection of the seizure. Such misclassifications did not occur when training was performed with samples taken within five minutes of the seizure onset."
