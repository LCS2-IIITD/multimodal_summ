http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_aholt_triangulation/,"Triangulation of a three-dimensional point from nâ‰¥2 two-dimensional images can be formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. We propose an algorithm to extract candidate solutions to this problem from its semidefinite programming relaxations. We then describe a sufficient condition and a polynomial time test for certifying when such a solution is optimal. This test has no false positives. Experiments indicate that false negatives are rare, and the algorithm has excellent performance in practice. We explain this phenomenon in terms of the geometry of the triangulation problem."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_xiao_museums/,"Photorealistic maps are a useful navigational guide for large indoor environments, such as museums and businesses. However, it is impossible to acquire photographs covering a large indoor environment from aerial viewpoints. This paper presents a 3D reconstruction and visualization system to automatically produce clean and well-regularized texture-mapped 3D models for large indoor scenes, from ground-level photographs and 3D laser points. The key component is a new algorithm called Inverse CSG for reconstructing a scene in a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) representation consisting of volumetric primitives, which imposes powerful regularization constraints to exploit structural regularities. We also propose several techniques to adjust the 3D model to make it suitable for rendering the 3D maps from aerial viewpoints. The visualization system enables users to easily browse a large scale indoor environment from a bird's -eye view, locate specific room interiors, fly into a place of interest, view immersive ground-level panorama views, and zoom out again, all with seamless 3D transitions. We demonstrate our system on various museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City - one of the largest art galleries in the world."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_bazavan_learning/,"Approximations based on random Fourier embeddings have recently emerged as an efficient and formally consistent methodology to design large-scale kernel machines [23]. By expressing the kernel as a Fourier expansion, features are generated based on a finite set of random basis projections, sampled from the Fourier transform of the kernel, with inner products that are Monte Carlo approximations of the original non-linear model. Based on the observation that different kernel induced Fourier sampling distributions correspond to different kernel parameters, we show that a scalable optimization process in the Fourier domain can be used to identify the different frequency bands that are useful for prediction on training data. This approach allows us to design a family of linear prediction models where we can learn the hyper-parameters of the kernel together with the weights of the feature vectors jointly. Under this methodology, we recover efficient and scalable linear reformulations for both single and multiple kernel learning. Experiments show that our linear models produce fast and accurate predictors for complex datasets such as the Visual Object Challenge 2011 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2011."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_kobayashi_optimization/,"In pattern classification, it is needed to efficiently treat two-way data (feature matrices) while preserving the two-way structure such as spatio-temporal relationships, etc. The classifier for the feature matrix is generally formulated by multiple bilinear forms which result in a matrix. The rank of the matrix, i.e., the number of bilinear forms, should be low from the viewpoint of generalization performance and computational cost. For that purpose, we propose a low-rank bilinear classifier based on the efficient optimization. In the proposed method, the classifier is optimized by minimizing the trace norm of the classifier (matrix), which contributes to the rank reduction for an efficient classifier without any hard constraint on the rank. We formulate the optimization problem in a tractable convex form and propose the procedure to solve it efficiently with the global optimum. In addition, by considering a kernel-based extension of the bilinear method, we induce a novel multiple kernel learning (MKL), called heterogeneous MKL. The method combines both inter kernels between heterogeneous types of features and the ordinary kernels within homogeneous features into a new discriminative kernel in a unified manner using the bilinear model. In the experiments on various classification problems using feature arrays, co-occurrence feature matrices, and multiple kernels, the proposed method exhibits favorable performances compared to the other methods."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_mensink_learning/,"We are interested in large-scale image classification and especially in the setting where images corresponding to new or existing classes are continuously added to the training set. Our goal is to devise classifiers which can incorporate such images and classes on-the-fly at (near) zero cost. We cast this problem into one of learning a metric which is shared across all classes and explore k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and nearest class mean (NCM) classifiers. We learn metrics on the ImageNet 2010 challenge data set, which contains more than 1.2M training images of 1K classes. Surprisingly, the NCM classifier compares favorably to the more flexible k-NN classifier, and has comparable performance to linear SVMs. We also study the generalization performance, among others by using the learned metric on the ImageNet-10K dataset, and we obtain competitive performance. Finally, we explore zero-shot classification, and show how the zero-shot model can be combined very effectively with small training datasets."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_kumar_vision/,"We describe the first mobile app for identifying plant species using automatic visual recognition. The system - called Leafsnap -  identifies tree species from photographs of their leaves. Key to this system are computer vision components for discarding non-leaf images, segmenting the leaf from an untextured background, extracting features representing the curvature of the leaf's contour over multiple scales, and identifying the species from a dataset of the 184 trees in the Northeastern United States. Our system obtains state-of-the-art performance on the real-world images from the new Leafsnap Dataset - the largest of its kind. Throughout the paper, we document many of the practical steps needed to produce a computer vision system such as ours, which currently has nearly a million users."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_baatz_images/,"Given a picture taken somewhere in the world, automatic geo-localization of that image is a task that would be extremely useful e.g. for historical and forensic sciences, documentation purposes, organization of the world's photo material and also intelligence applications. While tremendous progress has been made over the last years in visual location recognition within a single city, localization in natural environments is much more difficult, since vegetation, illumination, seasonal changes make appearance-only approaches impractical. In this work, we target mountainous terrain and use digital elevation models to extract representations for fast visual database lookup. We propose an automated approach for very large scale visual localization that can efficiently exploit visual information (contours) and geometric constraints (consistent orientation) at the same time. We validate the system on the scale of a whole country (Switzerland, 40000km2) using a new dataset of more than 200 landscape query pictures with ground truth."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_dubout_detectors/,"We describe a general and exact method to considerably speed up linear object detection systems operating in a sliding, multi-scale window fashion, such as the individual part detectors of part-based models. The main bottleneck of many of those systems is the computational cost of the convolutions between the multiple rescalings of the image to process, and the linear filters. We make use of properties of the Fourier transform and of clever implementation strategies to obtain a speedup factor proportional to the filters' sizes. The gain in performance is demonstrated on the well known Pascal VOC benchmark, where we accelerate the speed of said convolutions by an order of magnitude."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_razavi_object/,"Hough transform based methods for object detection work by allowing image features to vote for the location of the object. While this representation allows for parts observed in different training instances to support a single object hypothesis, it also produces false positives by accumulating votes that are consistent in location but inconsistent in other properties like pose, color, shape or type. In this work, we propose to augment the Hough transform with latent variables in order to enforce consistency among votes. To this end, only votes that agree on the assignment of the latent variable are allowed to support a single hypothesis. For training a Latent Hough Transform (LHT) model, we propose a learning scheme that exploits the linearity of the Hough transform based methods. Our experiments on two datasets including the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 benchmark show that our method outperforms traditional Hough transform based methods leading to state-of-the-art performance on some categories."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_karlinsky_models/,"We present an approach to the detection of parts of highly deformable objects, such as the human body. Instead of using kinematic constraints on relative angles used by most existing approaches for modeling part-to-part relations, we learn and use special observed 'linking' features that support particular pairwise part configurations. In addition to modeling the appearance of individual parts, the current approach adds modeling of the appearance of part-linking, which is shown to provide useful information. For example, configurations of the lower and upper arms are supported by observing corresponding appearances of the elbow or other relevant features. The proposed model combines the support from all the linking features observed in a test image to infer the most likely joint configuration of all the parts of interest. The approach is trained using images with annotated parts, but no a-priori known part connections or connection parameters are assumed, and the linking features are discovered automatically during training. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two challenging human body parts detection datasets, and obtain performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to the state-of-the-art. In addition, the approach generality is shown by applying it without modification to part detection on datasets of animal parts and of facial fiducial points."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_hoiem_detectors/,"This paper shows how to analyze the influences of object characteristics on detection performance and the frequency and impact of different types of false positives. In particular, we examine effects of occlusion, size, aspect ratio, visibility of parts, viewpoint, localization error, and confusion with semantically similar objects, other labeled objects, and background. We analyze two classes of detectors: the Vedaldi et al. multiple kernel learning detector and different versions of the Felzenszwalb et al. detector. Our study shows that sensitivity to size, localization error, and confusion with similar objects are the most impactful forms of error. Our analysis also reveals that many different kinds of improvement are necessary to achieve large gains, making more detailed analysis essential for the progress of recognition research. By making our software and annotations available, we make it effortless for future researchers to perform similar analysis."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_parikh_attributes/,"Traditional active learning allows a (machine) learner to query the (human) teacher for labels on examples it finds confusing. The teacher then provides a label for only that instance. This is quite restrictive. In this paper, we propose a learning paradigm in which the learner communicates its belief (i.e. predicted label) about the actively chosen example to the teacher. The teacher then confirms or rejects the predicted label. More importantly, if rejected, the teacher communicates an explanation for why the learner's belief was wrong. This explanation allows the learner to propagate the feedback provided by the teacher to many unlabeled images. This allows a classifier to better learn from its mistakes, leading to accelerated discriminative learning of visual concepts even with few labeled images. In order for such communication to be feasible, it is crucial to have a language that both the human supervisor and the machine learner understand. Attributes provide precisely this channel. They are human-interpretable mid-level visual concepts shareable across categories e.g. furry , spacious , etc. We advocate the use of attributes for a supervisor to provide feedback to a classifier and directly communicate his knowledge of the world. We employ a straightforward approach to incorporate this feedback in the classifier, and demonstrate its power on a variety of visual recognition scenarios such as image classification and annotation. This application of attributes for providing classifiers feedback is very powerful, and has not been explored in the community. It introduces a new mode of supervision, and opens up several avenues for future research."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_shrivastava_attributes/,"We consider the problem of semi-supervised bootstrap learning for scene categorization. Existing semi-supervised approaches are typically unreliable and face semantic drift because the learning task is under-constrained. This is primarily because they ignore the strong interactions that often exist between scene categories, such as the common attributes shared across categories as well as the attributes which make one scene different from another. The goal of this paper is to exploit these relationships and constrain the semi-supervised learning problem. For example, the knowledge that an image is an auditorium can improve labeling of amphitheaters by enforcing constraint that an amphitheater image should have more circular structures than an auditorium image. We propose constraints based on mutual exclusion, binary attributes and comparative attributes and show that they help us to constrain the learning problem and avoid semantic drift. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, including results on a very large dataset of one million images."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_ramanan_actions/,"We present a novel approach to modeling human pose, together with interacting objects, based on compositional models of local visual interactions and their relations. Skeleton models, while flexible enough to capture large articulations, fail to accurately model selfocclusions and interactions. Poselets and Visual Phrases address this limitation, but do so at the expense of requiring a large set of templates. We combine all three approaches with a compositional model that is flexible enough to model detailed articulations but still captures occlusions and object interactions. Unlike much previous work on action classification, we do not assume test images are labeled with a person, and instead present results for action detection in an unlabeled image. Notably, for each detection, our model reports back a detailed description including an action label, articulated human pose, object poses, and occlusion flags. We demonstrate that modeling occlusion is crucial for recognizing human-object interactions. We present results on the PASCAL Action Classification challenge that shows our unified model advances the state-of-the-art for detection, action classification, and articulated pose estimation."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_yao_action/,"This paper deals with recognizing human actions in still images. We make two key contributions. (1) We propose a novel, 2.5D representation of action images that considers both viewindependent pose information and rich appearance information. A 2.5D graph of an action image consists of a set of nodes that are keypoints of the human body, as well as a set of edges that are spatial relationships between the nodes. Each key-point is represented by view-independent 3D positions and local 2D appearance features. The similarity between two action images can then be measured by matching their corresponding 2.5D graphs. (2) We use an exemplar based action classification approach, where a set of representative images are selected for each action class. The selected images cover large within-action variations and carry discriminative information compared with the other classes. This exemplar based representation of action classes further makes our approach robust to pose variations and occlusions. We test our method on two publicly available datasets and show that it achieves very promising performance."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_amer_recognition/,"This paper addresses a new problem, that of multiscale activity recognition. Our goal is to detect and localize a wide range of activities, including individual actions and group activities, which may simultaneously co-occur in high-resolution video. The video resolution allows for digital zoom-in (or zoom-out) for examining fine details (or coarser scales), as needed for recognition. The key challenge is how to avoid running a multitude of detectors at all spatiotemporal scales, and yet arrive at a holistically consistent video interpretation. To this end, we use a three-layered AND-OR graph to jointly model group activities, individual actions, and participating objects. The AND-OR graph allows a principled formulation of efficient, cost-sensitive inference via an explore-exploit strategy. Our inference optimally schedules the following computational processes: 1) direct application of activity detectors-called Î± process; 2) bottom-up inference based on detecting activity parts-called Î² process; and 3) top-down inference based on detecting activity context-called Î³ process. The scheduling iteratively maximizes the log-posteriors of the resulting parse graphs. For evaluation, we have compiled and benchmarked a new dataset of high-resolution videos of group and individual activities co-occurring in a courtyard of the UCLA campus."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_kitani_forecasting/,"We address the task of inferring the future actions of people from noisy visual input. We denote this task activity forecasting. To achieve accurate activity forecasting, our approach models the effect of the physical environment on the choice of human actions. This is accomplished by the use of state of-the-art semantic scene understanding combined with ideas from optimal control theory. Our unified model also integrates several other key elements of activity analysis, namely, destination forecasting, sequence smoothing and transfer learning. As proof-of-concept, we focus on the domain of trajectory-based activity analysis from visual input. Experimental results demonstrate that our model accurately predicts distributions over future actions of individuals. We show how the same techniques can improve the results of tracking algorithms by leveraging information about likely goals and trajectories."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_choi_recognition/,"We present a coherent, discriminative framework for simultaneously tracking multiple people and estimating their collective activities. Instead of treating the two problems separately, our model is grounded in the intuition that a strong correlation exists between a person's motion, their  activity, and the motion and activities of other nearby people. Instead of directly linking the solutions to these two problems, we introduce a hierarchy of activity types that creates a natural progression that leads from a specific person's motion to the activity of the group as a whole. Our model is capable of jointly tracking multiple people, recognizing individual activities (atomic activities), the interactions between pairs of people (interaction activities), and finally the behavior of groups of people (collective activities). We also propose an algorithm for solving this otherwise intractable joint inference problem by combining belief propagation with a version of the branch and bound algorithm equipped with integer programming. Experimental results on challenging video datasets demonstrate our theoretical claims and indicate that our model achieves the best collective activity classification results to date."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_batra_markov/,"Much effort has been directed at algorithms for obtaining the highest probability (MAP) configuration in probabilistic (random field) models. In many situations, one could benefit from additional high probability solutions. Current methods for computing the M most probable configurations produce solutions that tend to be very similar to the MAP solution and each other. This is often an undesirable property. In this paper we propose an algorithm for the Diverse MBest problem, which involves finding a diverse set of highly probable solutions under a discrete probabilistic model. Given a dissimilarity function measuring closeness of two solutions, our formulation involves maximizing a linear combination of the probability and dissimilarity to previous solutions. Our formulation generalizes the MBest MAP problem and we show that for certain families of dissimilarity functions we can guarantee that these solutions can be found as easily as the MAP solution."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_arora_algorithm/,We propose a new algorithm called Generic Cuts for computing optimal solutions to 2 label MRF-MAP problems with higher order clique potentials satisfying submodularity. The algorithm runs in time O(2kn3) in the worst case (k is clique order and n is the number of pixels). A special gadget is introduced to model flows in a high order clique and a technique for building a flow graph is specified. Based on the primal dual structure of the optimization problem the notions of capacity of an edge and cut are generalized to define a flow problem. We show that in this flow graph max flow is equal to min cut which also is the optimal solution to the problem when potentials are submodular. This is in contrast to all prevalent techniques of optimizing Boolean energy functions involving higher order potentials including those based on reductions to quadratic potential functions which provide only approximate solutions even for submodular functions. We show experimentally that our implementation of the Generic Cuts algorithm is more than an order of magnitude faster than all algorithms including reduction based whose outputs on submodular potentials are near optimal.
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_vineet_filter/,"Recently, a number of cross bilateral filtering methods have been proposed for solving multi-label problems in computer vision, such as stereo, optical flow and object class segmentation that show an order of magnitude improvement in speed over previous methods. These methods have achieved good results despite using models with only unary and/or pairwise terms. However, previous work has shown the value of using models with higher-order terms e.g. to represent label consistency over large regions, or global co-occurrence relations. We show how these higher-order terms can be formulated such that filter-based inference remains possible. We demonstrate our techniques on joint stereo and object labeling problems, as well as object class segmentation, showing in addition for joint object-stereo labeling how our method provides an efficient approach to inference in product label-spaces. We show that we are able to speed up inference in these models around 10-30 times with respect to competing graph-cut/move-making methods, as well as maintaining or improving accuracy in all cases. We show results on PascalVOC-10 for object class segmentation, and Leuven for joint object-stereo labeling."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_yamaguchi_stereo/,"In this paper we present a novel slanted-plane model which reasons jointly about occlusion boundaries as well as depth. We formulate the problem as one of inference in a hybrid MRF composed of both continuous (i.e., slanted 3D planes) and discrete (i.e., occlusion boundaries) random variables. This allows us to define potentials encoding the ownership of the pixels that compose the boundary between segments, as well as potentials encoding which junctions are physically possible. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on Middlebury high resolution imagery [1] as well as in the more challenging KITTI dataset [2], while being more efficient than existing slanted plane MRF methods, taking on average 2 minutes to perform inference on high resolution imagery."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_hu_deblur/,"The goal of single image deblurring is to recover both a latent clear image and an underlying blur kernel from one input blurred image. Recent works focus on exploiting natural image priors or additional image observations for deblurring, but pay less attention to the influence of image structures on estimating blur kernels. What is the useful image structure and how can one select good regions for deblurring? We formulate the problem of learning good regions for deblurring within the Conditional Random Field framework. To better compare blur kernels, we develop an effective similarity metric for labeling training samples. The learned model is able to predict good regions from an input blurred image for deblurring without user guidance. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that good regions can be selected by the proposed algorithms for effective image deblurring."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_levin_denoising/,"Image restoration tasks are ill-posed problems, typically solved with priors. Since the optimal prior is the exact unknown density of natural images, actual priors are only approximate and typically restricted to small patches. This raises several questions: How much may we hope to improve current restoration results with future sophisticated algorithms? And more fundamentally, even with perfect knowledge of natural image statistics, what is the inherent ambiguity of the problem? In addition, since most current methods are limited to finite support patches or kernels, what is the relation between the patch complexity of natural images, patch size, and restoration errors? Focusing on image denoising, we make several contributions. First, in light of computational constraints, we study the relation between denoising gain and sample size requirements in a non parametric approach. We present a law of diminishing return, namely that with increasing patch size, rare patches not only require a much larger dataset, but also gain little from it. This result suggests novel adaptive variable-sized patch schemes for denoising. Second, we study absolute denoising limits, regardless of the algorithm used, and the converge rate to them as a function of patch size. Scale invariance of natural images plays a key role here and implies both a strictly positive lower bound on denoising and a power law convergence. Extrapolating this parametric law gives a ballpark estimate of the best achievable denoising, suggesting that some improvement, although modest, is still possible."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_fouhey_geometry/,We present an approach which exploits the coupling between human actions and scene geometry. We investigate the use of human pose as a cue for single-view 3D scene understanding. Our method builds upon recent advances in still-image pose estimation to extract functional and geometric constraints about the scene. These constraints are then used to improve state-of-the-art single-view 3D scene understanding approaches. The proposed method is validated on a collection of monocular time-lapse sequences collected from YouTube and a data set of still images of indoor scenes. We demonstrate that observing people performing different actions can significantly improve estimates of 3D scene geometry.
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_silberman_images/,"We present an approach to interpret the major surfaces, objects, and support relations of an indoor scene from an RGBD image. Most existing work ignores physical interactions or is applied only to tidy rooms and hallways. Our goal is to parse typical, often messy, indoor scenes into floor, walls, supporting surfaces, and object regions, and to recover support relationships. One of our main interests is to better understand how 3D cues can best inform a structured 3D interpretation. We also contribute a novel integer programming formulation to infer physical support relations. We offer a new dataset of 1449 RGBD images, capturing 464 diverse indoor scenes, with detailed annotations. Our experiments demonstrate our ability to infer support relations in complex scenes and verify that our 3D scene cues and inferred support lead to better object segmentation."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_guo_labeling/,"Scene understanding requires reasoning about both what we can see and what is occluded. We offer a simple and general approach to infer labels of occluded background regions. Our approach incorporates estimates of visible surrounding background, detected objects, and shape priors from transferred training regions. We demonstrate the ability to infer the labels of occluded background regions in both the outdoor StreetScenes dataset and an indoor scene dataset using the same approach. Our experiments show that our method outperforms competent baselines."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_karsch_sampling/,"We describe a technique that automatically generates plausible depth maps from videos using non-parametric depth sampling. We demonstrate our technique in cases where past methods fail (nontranslating cameras and dynamic scenes). Our technique is applicable to single images as well as videos. For videos, we use local motion cues to improve the inferred depth maps, while optical flow is used to ensure temporal depth consistency. For training and evaluation, we use a Kinect-based system to collect a large dataset containing stereoscopic videos with known depths. We show that our depth estimation technique outperforms the state-of-the-art on benchmark databases. Our technique can be used to automatically convert a monoscopic video into stereo for 3D visualization, and we demonstrate this through a variety of visually pleasing results for indoor and outdoor scenes, including results from the feature film Charade."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_kowdle_stereo/,"We present an automatic approach to segment an object in calibrated images acquired from multiple viewpoints. Our system starts with a new piecewise planar layer-based stereo algorithm that estimates a dense depth map that consists of a set of 3D planar surfaces. The algorithm is formulated using an energy minimization framework that combines stereo and appearance cues, where for each surface, an appearance model is learnt using an unsupervised approach. By treating the planar surfaces as structural elements of the scene and reasoning about their visibility in multiple views, we segment the object in each image independently. Finally, these segmentations are refined by probabilistically fusing information across multiple views. We demonstrate that our approach can segment challenging objects with complex shapes and topologies, which may have thin structures and non-Lambertian surfaces. It can also handle scenarios where the object and background color distributions overlap significantly."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_lombardi_image/,"Estimating reflectance and natural illumination from a single image of an object of known shape is a challenging task due to the ambiguities between reflectance and illumination. Although there is an inherent limitation in what can be recovered as the reflectance band-limits the illumination, explicitly estimating both is desirable for many computer vision applications. Achieving this estimation requires that we derive and impose strong constraints on both variables. We introduce a probabilistic formulation that seamlessly incorporates such constraints as priors to arrive at the maximum a posteriori estimates of reflectance and natural illumination. We begin by showing that reflectance modulates the natural illumination in a way that increases its entropy. Based on this observation, we impose a prior on the illumination that favors lower entropy while conforming to natural image statistics. We also impose a prior on the reflectance based on the directional statistics BRDF model that constrains the estimate to lie within the bounds and variability of real-world materials. Experimental results on a number of synthetic and real images show that the method is able to achieve accurate joint estimation for different combinations of materials and lighting."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_ramamoorthi_decomposition/,"We show that, under spatially varying illumination, the light transport of diffuse scenes can be decomposed into direct, near-range (subsurface scattering and local inter-reflections) and far-range transports (diffuse inter-reflections). We show that these three component transports are redundant either in the spatial or the frequency domain and can be separated using appropriate illumination patterns. We propose a novel, efficient method to sequentially separate and acquire the component transports. First, we acquire the direct transport by extending the direct-global separation technique from floodlit images to full transport matrices. Next, we separate and acquire the near-range transport by illuminating patterns sampled uniformly in the frequency domain. Finally, we acquire the far-range transport by illuminating low-frequency patterns. We show that theoretically, our acquisition method achieves the lower bound our model places on the required number of patterns. We quantify the savings in number of patterns over the brute force approach. We validate our observations and acquisition method with rendered and real examples throughout."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_butler_optical/,"Ground truth optical flow is difficult to measure in real scenes with natural motion. As a result, optical flow data sets are restricted in terms of size, complexity, and diversity, making optical flow algorithms difficult to train and test on realistic data. We introduce a new optical flow data set derived from the open source 3D animated short film Sintel. This data set has important features not present in the popular Middlebury flow evaluation: long sequences, large motions, specular reflections, motion blur, defocus blur, and atmospheric effects. Because the graphics data that generated the movie is open source, we are able to render scenes under conditions of varying complexity to evaluate where existing flow algorithms fail. We evaluate several recent optical flow algorithms and find that current highly-ranked methods on the Middlebury evaluation have difficulty with this more complex data set suggesting further research on optical flow estimation is needed. To validate the use of synthetic data, we compare the image- and flow-statistics of Sintel to those of real films and videos and show that they are similar. The data set, metrics, and evaluation website are publicly available."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_corso_video/,"The use of video segmentation as an early processing step in video analysis lags behind the use of image segmentation for image analysis, despite many available video segmentation methods. A major reason for this lag is simply that videos are an order of magnitude bigger than images; yet most methods require all voxels in the video to be loaded into memory, which is clearly prohibitive for even medium length videos. We address this limitation by proposing an approximation framework for streaming hierarchical video segmentation motivated by data stream algorithms: each video frame is processed only once and does not change the segmentation of previous frames. We implement the graph-based hierarchical segmentation method within our streaming framework; our method is the first streaming hierarchical video segmentation method proposed. We perform thorough experimental analysis on a benchmark video data set and longer videos. Our results indicate the graph-based streaming hierarchical method outperforms other streaming video segmentation methods and performs nearly as well as the full-video hierarchical graph-based method."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_ballan_motion/,"Capturing the motion of two hands interacting with an object is a very challenging task due to the large number of degrees of freedom, selfocclusions, and similarity between the fingers, even in the case of multiple cameras observing the scene. In this paper we propose to use discriminatively learned salient points on the fingers and to estimate the finger-salient point associations simultaneously with the estimation of the hand pose. We introduce a differentiable objective function that also takes edges, optical flow and collisions into account. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the proposed approach achieves very accurate results for several challenging sequences containing hands and objects in action."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_basha_photo/,"Dynamic events such as family gatherings, concerts or sports events are often captured by a group of people. The set of still images obtained this way is rich in dynamic content but lacks accurate temporal information. We propose a method for photo-sequencing --- temporally ordering a set of still images taken asynchronously by a set of uncalibrated cameras. Photo-sequencing is an essential tool in analyzing (or visualizing) a dynamic scene captured by still images. The first step of the method detects sets of corresponding static and dynamic feature points across images. The static features are used to determine the epipolar geometry between pairs of images, and each dynamic feature votes for the temporal order of the images in which it appears. The partial orders provided by the dynamic features are not necessarily consistent, and we use rank aggregation to combine them into a globally consistent temporal order of images. We demonstrate successful photo sequencing on several challenging collections of images taken using a number of mobile phones."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_martinovic_parsing/,"We propose a novel three-layered approach for semantic segmentation of building facades. In the first layer, starting from an oversegmentation of a facade, we employ the recently introduced machine learning technique Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) to obtain a probabilistic interpretation of each segment. In the second layer, initial labeling is augmented with the information coming from specialized facade component detectors. The information is merged using a Markov Random Field. In the third layer, we introduce weak architectural knowledge, which enforces the final reconstruction to be architecturally plausible and consistent. Rigorous tests performed on two existing datasets of building facades demonstrate that we significantly outperform the current-state of the art, even when using outputs from earlier layers of the pipeline. Also, we show how the final output of the third layer can be used to create a procedural reconstruction."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_carreira_semantic/,"Feature extraction, coding and pooling, are important components on many contemporary object recognition paradigms. In this paper we explore novel pooling techniques that encode the second-order statistics of local descriptors inside a region. To achieve this effect, we introduce multiplicative second-order analogues of average and maxpooling that together with appropriate non-linearities lead to state-ofthe- art performance on free-form region recognition, without any type of feature coding. Instead of coding, we found that enriching local descriptors with additional image information leads to large performance gains, especially in conjunction with the proposed pooling methodology. We show that second-order pooling over freeform regions produces results superior to those of the winning systems in the Pascal VOC 2011 semantic segmentation challenge, with models that are 20,000 times faster."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_kim_shape/,"We introduce a category-independent shape prior for object segmentation. Existing shape priors assume class-specific knowledge, and thus are restricted to cases where the object class is known in advance. The main insight of our approach is that shapes are often shared between objects of different categories. To exploit this shape sharing phenomenon, we develop a non-parametric prior that transfers object shapes from an exemplar database to a test image based on local shape matching. The transferred shape priors are then enforced in a graph-cut formulation to produce a pool of object segment hypotheses. Unlike previous multiple segmentation methods, our approach benefits from global shape cues; unlike previous top-down methods, it assumes no class-specific training and thus enhances segmentation even for unfamiliar categories. On the challenging PASCAL 2010 and Berkeley Segmentation data sets, we show it outperforms the state-of-the-art in bottom-up or category independent segmentation."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_guillaumin_segmentation/,"ImageNet is a large-scale hierarchical database of object classes. We propose to automatically populate it with pixelwise segmentations, by leveraging existing manual annotations in the form of class labels and bounding-boxes. The key idea is to recursively exploit images segmented so far to guide the segmentation of new images. At each stage this propagation process expands into the images which are easiest to segment at that point in time, e.g. by moving to the semantically most related classes to those segmented so far. The propagation of segmentation occurs both (a) at the image level, by transferring existing segmentations to estimate the probability of a pixel to be foreground, and (b) at the class level, by jointly segmenting images of the same class and by importing the appearance models of classes that are already segmented. Through an experiment on 577 classes and 500k images we show that our technique (i) annotates a wide range of classes with accurate segmentations; (ii) effectively exploits the hierarchical structure of ImageNet; (iii) scales efficiently; (iv) outperforms a baseline GrabCut [1] initialized on the image center, as well as our recent segmentation transfer technique [2] on which this paper is based. Moreover, our method also delivers state-of- the-art results on the recent iCoseg dataset for co-segmentation."
http://videolectures.net/eccv2012_faktor_image/,"We define a good image cluster as one in which images can be easily composed (like a puzzle) using pieces from each other, while are difficult to compose from images outside the cluster. The larger and more statistically significant the pieces are, the stronger the affinity between the images. This gives rise to unsupervised discovery of very challenging image categories. We further show how multiple images can be composed from each other simultaneously and efficiently using a collaborative randomized search algorithm. This collaborative process exploits the wisdom of crowds of images , to obtain a sparse yet meaningful set of image affinities, and in time which is almost linear in the size of the image collection. ''Clustering-by- Composition'' can be applied to very few images (where a 'cluster model' can not be 'learned') as well as on benchmark evaluation datasets, and yields state-of-the-art results."
