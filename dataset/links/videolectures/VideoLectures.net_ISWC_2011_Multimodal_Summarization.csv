The rapid spread of ubiquitous networks, and connected sensors such as those contained in smartphones and cars, allow these networks to be reinvented as much more active and reactive control networks - at the scale of the individual, the family, the enterprise, the city and the nation. This will fundamentally transform the economics of health, finance, logistics, and transportation. One key challenge is access to the personal data at scale to enable these systems to function more efficiently. In discussions with key CEOs, regulators, and NGOs at the World Economic Forum we have constructed a ""new deal on data"" that can allow personal data to emerge as accessible asset class that provides strong protection for individuals. The talk will also cover a range of prototype systems and experiments developed at MIT, outline some of the challenges and growth opportunities, focusing on how this new data ecosystem may end up strongly promoting but also shaping the semantic web."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_van_harmelen_universal/,"At 10 years of age, there is little doubt that the Semantic Web is an engineering success, with substantial (and growing) take-up in business, government and media. However, as a scientific field, have we discovered any general principles? Have we uncovered any universal patterns that give us insights into the structure of data, information and knowledge, patterns that are valid beyond the engineering of the Semantic Web in its current form? If we would build the Semantic Web again, surely some things would end up looking different, but are there things that would end up looking the same, simply because they have to be that way?"
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_weikum_triples/,"The Web of Linked Data contains about 25 billion RDF triples and almost half a billion links across data sources; it is becoming a great asset for semantic applications. Linked Data comprises large general-purpose knowledge bases like DBpedia, Yago, and Freebase, as well as many reference collections in a wide variety of areas, spanning sciences, culture, entertainment, and more. Notwithstanding the great potential of Linked Data, this talk argues that there are significant limitations that need to be overcome for further progress. These limitations regard data scope and, especially, data quality. The talk discuss these issues and approaches to extending and enriching Linked Data, in order to improve its scope, quality, interpretability, cross-linking, and usefulness."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_valle_bottari/,"Location-based services are influencing our lives and the way we experience the surrounding environment; smart phone and tablet applications supply a huge amount of information: shops around us, traffic conditions, etc. A recent trend in this kind of services is to provide personalized information, such as friends' position or events users could be interested in. In this paper we present BOTTARI, an Android application that exploits social media and context to provide point of interest (POI) recommendations to user in a specific geographic location. BOTTARI exploits a number of semantic techniques (sentiment analysis, inductive reasoning, stream reasoning) for social media analysis and suggests POIs on the basis of users' tastes and influencing people's opinion."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_sacco_seevl/,"Seevl mines music connections from the Web to bring context, search and discovery for the music you like, directly within your favorite applications. We rely on the latest Semantic Web / Linked Data technologies in order to (1) aggregate, interlink and consolidate data, (2) deliver meaningful search and discovery services and (3) build plug-ins providing those features in existing applications."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_phuoc_web/,"Sensing devices are becoming the source of a large portion of theWeb data. To facilitate the integration of sensed data with data from other sources, both sensor stream sources and data are being enriched with semantic descriptions, creating Linked Stream Data. Despite its enormous potential, little has been done to explore Linked Stream Data. One of the main characteristics of such data is its “live” nature, which prohibits existing Linked Data technologies to be applied directly. Moreover, there is currently a lack of tools to facilitate publishing Linked Stream Data and making it available to other applications. To address these issues we have developed the Linked Stream Middleware (LSM), a platform that brings together the live real world sensed data and the Semantic Web. A LSM deployment is available at http://lsm.deri.ie/. It provides many functionalities such as: i) wrappers for real time data collection and publishing; ii) a web interface for data annotation and visualisation; and iii) a SPARQL endpoint for querying unified Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. In this paper we describe the system architecture behind LSM, provide details how Linked Stream Data is generated, and demonstrate the benefits of the platform by showcasing its interface."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_scherp_data/,"We present SchemEX, an approach and tool for web-scale, real-time indexing and schema extraction of Linked Open Data (LOD) at linear runtime complexity. As we cannot assume that a complete retrieval of the LOD cloud on a local machine is feasible, we follow a stream-based approach that makes no assumption about how the RDF triples are retrieved from the web by a data crawler. We show the applicability of our approach by applying SchemEX to the Billion Triple Challenge Dataset 2011 and a smaller dataset with 11M triples."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_nuzzolese_semantic/,"Aemoo is a Web application supporting exploratory search over the Semantic Web. Through a simple keyword-based search interface, users can query Aemoo for information about any entity, which is then collected by aggregating knowledge from diverse sources such as linked data, Wikipedia, Twitter, and Google News. Such aggregation is performed according to cognitively-sound principles through the exploitation of knowledge patterns, and by exploiting semantic relations as well as interpreting hypertext links. Aemoo provides users with an eeffective summary of knowledge about an entity, including explanations that clarify its relevance, and presents it through a user-friendly interface that supports exploration of further knowledge."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_bohm_ontology/,"As Linked Open Data originates from various sources, lever- aging well-defined ontologies aids integration. However, oftentimes the utilization of RDF vocabularies by data publishers differs from the in- tended application envisioned by ontology engineers. Especially in large- scale datasets as presented in the Billion Triple Challenge a significant divergence between vocabulary specification and usage patterns can be observed. This may impede the goals of the Web of Data in terms of dis- covering domain-specific information in the Semantic Web. In this work, we identify common misusage patterns by employing frequency analysis and rule mining and propose re-engineering suggestions."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_papadakis_service/,"Augmented and meaningful interlinking between the triple- stores of the lod cloud is vital to the success of the linked-data movement; the employment of URIs alone is not enough to integrate datasets and make them accessible to humans and machines. In this paper, a layered interlinking architecture is presented, based on the concept of a registry, a place where linked-data services can store information about entities in an open and expandable way. As a demonstrator for the Billion Triple Challenge, an autosuggest application is presented (http://thalassa.ionio.gr/ranked/), capable of enhancing the interlinking among diverse datasets through the utilization of backlinks, i.e. references to the URIs of a local dataset originating from remote datasets."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_panel/,"The past couple of years have been an ""interesting time"" for the Semantic Web - with both the positive and negative aspects that that implies.  We have seen new standards emerging from the W3C, new proposals out of Google and Facebook which have different visions for the future, and a growing application space struggling to make head or tail out of all of it. Schema.org? OWL 2.0? RDFa? who controls the vision of the Semantic Web's future?"
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_kleedorfer_needs/,"The Web as related to commerce suffers from a fundamental asymmetry. While there is a great number of commercial offers available, consumer needs are rarely represented explicitly. Thus, the most widely applied process of connecting the prospective consumer of a resource with its supplier is Web search. We challenge the Semantic Web community to develop an infrastructure that allows consumers to describe and publish their needs and have them interact with offers in a semi-automatic process, reducing the need for manual search and enabling a wide range of unprecedented applications."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_demartini_platform/,"Progress in science relies nowadays on collaborative efforts of large communities. A single human being has no more the capacity to process all the information necessary to fully comprehend the experimental facts and implications of scientific experiments. We claim that this will result in a fundamental phase transition in how scientific results are obtained, represented, used, communicated and attributed. Different to the classical view of how science is performed, important discoveries will be not only the result of exceptional individual efforts and talents, but alternatively an emergent property of a complex community-based socio-technical system. We even speculate that certain discoveries might be of such a complexity that human individuals might no more be able to fully grasp the underlying models and methods. This has fundamental implications on how we perceive the role of technical systems and in particular information processing infrastructures for scientific work: They are no longer a subordinate instrument that facilitates (or makes more miserable) daily work of highly gifted individuals, but become an essential tool and enabler for performing scientific progress, and eventually might be the instrument within which scientific discoveries are made, represented and brought to use."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_schlobach_web/,"Linked Data has been designed on the basis of the Web of Documents and pushed by individuals with privileged access to Web technologies. As a result, Web hosted applications and data servers have become the de-facto standard for setting up data-sharing platforms. But what about the estimated 4.5 billion underprivileged without access to the Web but with a need and the willingness to share data? This paper calls for taking in account everybody in future design choices for Linked Data. We claim that \Web-free"" publication is possible, and beneficial, for Linked Open Data everywhere - even without access to the Web."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_novacek_meaning/,"Our outrageous idea concerns the very core of the Semantic Web { the (lack of) semantics themselves. In Section 1 we claim that the presently used conception of web semantics fails to capture the link between the machine-readable descriptions and their actual meaning (in the sense of a formal grounding in reality). We also argue that this is inherently related to culprits of various difficulties the community has been coping with (e.g., knowledge acquisition bottleneck or data integration challenges). In Section 2 we propose a remedy of this unsatisfactory state of aairs { a broadened notion of emergent web meaning that can be derived in a bottom-up manner from the web data using principles of distributional semantics. Section 3 gives an overview of a preliminary solution [1] we recently implemented with promising results. Finally, we outline directions of future research required to fully realise our vision."
http://videolectures.net/iswc2011_liarou_links/,"The trend for more online linked data becomes stronger. Foreseeing a future where ""everything"" will be online and linked, we ask the critical question; what is next? We envision that managing, querying and storying large amounts of links and data is far from yet another query processing task. We highlight two distinct and promising research directions towards managing and making sense of linked data. We introduce linked views to help focusing on specific link and data instances and linked history to help observe how links and data change over time."
