http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_aral_influence/,"Many of us are interested in whether ""networks matter."" Whether in the spread of disease, the diffusion of information, the propagation of behavioral contagions, the effectiveness of viral marketing, or the magnitude of peer effects in a variety of settings, two key questions must be answered before we can understand whether networks matter: 1) how the content that flows through networks affects the patterns of outcomes we see across nodes and 2) whether the statistical relationships we observe can be interpreted causally. Aral will review what we know and where research might go with respect to content and causality in networks. He will provide two examples from each area to structure the discussion: One from an analysis of email networks and the information content that flows through them at a mid-sized executive recruiting firm and the other from a randomized field experiment on a popular social networking website that tests the effectiveness of ""viral product design"" strategies in creating peer influence and social contagion among the 1.4 million friends of 9,687 experimental users."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_seligstein_trends/,"Over the last few years, digital messaging has seen dramatic shifts in the mediums used to communicate, message length and priority, and expectations about who can contact who. The most recent release of Facebook Messages aims to recognize these trends and ease the complex scenarios these create. In this talk, Seligstein will go over how they've addressed each problem and the challenges these solutions have created."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_watts_virtual/,"Crowdsourcing sites like Amazon's Mechanical Turk are increasingly being used by researchers to construct ""virtual labs"" in which they can conduct behavioral experiments. In this talk, I describe some recent experiments that showcase the advantages of virtual over traditional physical labs, as well as some of the limitations. I then discuss how this relatively new experimental capability may unfold in the near future, along with some implications for social and behavioral science."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_amer_yahia_consumption/,"The proliferation of social media is changing the ways news are produced and consumed. Recent events in the Arabic Spring showed the power of user-generated content such as amateur videos on YouTube, and Twitter posts, in instigating change. The question we ask in this panel is how technologies can be used to channel people's energy and enable the continuous generation of relevant, timely and trusted content. We span a wide range of questions covering reliable connection, social spam and centralized/decentralized news curation. On the consumption side, we contrast news dissemination from popular trusted sources and viral propagation from friends. We also explore event extraction and adapting existing techniques such as opinion mining to process large amounts of news in a way appealing to users. Those are some of the questions that will be raised by our panelits who have a wide range of expertise in using or developing social media technologies to enable news delivery today."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_verma_awareness/,"In times of mass emergency, vast amounts of data are generated via computer-mediated communication (CMC) that are difficult to manually cull and organize into a coherent picture. Yet valuable information is broadcast, and can provide useful insight into time- and safety-critical situations if captured and analyzed properly and rapidly. We describe an approach for automatically identifying messages communicated via Twitter that contribute to situational awareness, and explain why it is beneficial for those seeking information during mass emergencies. We collected Twitter messages from four different crisis events of varying nature and magnitude and built a classifier to automatically detect messages that may contribute to situational awareness, utilizing a combination of hand annotated and automatically-extracted linguistic features. Our system was able to achieve over 80% accuracy on categorizing tweets that contribute to situational awareness. Additionally, we show that a classifier developed for a specific emergency event performs well on similar events. The results are promising, and have the potential to aid the general public in culling and analyzing information communicated during times of mass emergency."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_scellato_spatial/,"The spatial structure of large-scale online social networks has been largely unaccessible due to the lack of available and accurate data about people’s location. However, with the recent surging popularity of location-based social services, data about the geographic position of users have been available for the first time, together with their online social connections. In this work we present a comprehensive study of the spatial properties of the social networks arising among users of three main popular online location-based services. We observe robust universal features across them: while all networks exhibit about 40% of links below 100 km, we further discover strong heterogeneity across users, with different characteristic spatial lengths of interaction across both their social ties and social triads. We provide evidence that mechanisms akin to gravity models may influence how these social connections are created over space. Our results constitute the first largescale study to unravel the socio-spatial properties of online location-based social networks."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_cheng_footprints/,"Location sharing services (LSS) like Foursquare, Gowalla, and Facebook Places support hundreds of millions of userdriven footprints (i.e., “checkins”). Those global-scale footprints provide a unique opportunity to study the social and temporal characteristics of how people use these services and to model patterns of human mobility, which are significant factors for the design of future mobile+location-based services, traffic forecasting, urban planning, as well as epidemiological models of disease spread. In this paper, we investigate 22 million checkins across 220,000 users and report a quantitative assessment of human mobility patterns by analyzing the spatial, temporal, social, and textual aspects associated with these footprints. We find that: (i) LSS users follow the “L`evy Flight” mobility pattern and adopt periodic behaviors; (ii) While geographic and economic constraints affect mobility patterns, so does individual social status; and (iii) Content and sentiment-based analysis of posts associated with checkins can provide a rich source of context for better understanding how users engage with these services."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_paul_health/,"Analyzing user messages in social media can measure different population characteristics, including public health measures. For example, recent work has correlated Twitter messages with influenza rates in the United States; but this has largely been the extent of mining Twitter for public health. In this work, we consider a broader range of public health applications for Twitter. We apply the recently introduced Ailment Topic Aspect Model to over one and a half million health related tweets and discover mentions of over a dozen ailments, including allergies, obesity and insomnia. We introduce extensions to incorporate prior knowledge into this model and apply it to several tasks: tracking illnesses over times (syndromic surveillance), measuring behavioral risk factors, localizing illnesses by geographic region, and analyzing symptoms and medication usage. We show quantitative correlations with public health data and qualitative evaluations of model output. Our results suggest that Twitter has broad applicability for public health research."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_steeg_epidemics/,"Theoretical progress in understanding the dynamics of spreading processes on graphs suggests the existence of an epidemic threshold below which no epidemics form and above which epidemics spread to a significant fraction of the graph. We have observed information cascades on the social media site Digg that spread fast enough for one initial spreader to infect hundreds of people, yet end up affecting only 0.1% of the entire network. We find that two effects, previously studied in isolation, combine cooperatively to drastically limit the final size of cascades on Digg. First, because of the highly clustered structure of the Digg network, most people who are aware of a story have been exposed to it via multiple friends. This structure lowers the epidemic threshold while moderately slowing the overall growth of cascades. In addition, we find that the mechanism for social contagion on Digg points to a fundamental difference between information spread and other contagion processes: despite multiple opportunities for infection within a social group, people are less likely to become spreaders of information with repeated exposure. The consequences of this mechanism become more pronounced for more clustered graphs. Ultimately, this effect severely curtails the size of social epidemics on Digg."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_sharara_viral/,"Viral marketing mechanisms use the existing social network between customers to spread information about products and encourage product adoption. Existing viral marketing models focus on the dynamics of the diffusion process, however they typically: (a) only consider a single product campaign and (b) fail to model the evolution of the social network, as the trust between individuals changes over time, during the course of multiple campaigns. In this work, we propose an adaptive viral marketing model which captures: (1) multiple different product campaigns, (2) the diversity in customer preferences among different product categories, and (3) changing confidence in peers’ recommendations over time. By applying our model to a real-world network extracted from the Digg social news website, we provide insights into the effects of network dynamics on the different products’ adoption. Our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms earlier non-adaptive diffusion models in predicting future product adoptions. We also show how this model can be used to explore new viral marketing strategies that are more successful than classic strategies which ignore the dynamic nature of social networks."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_sun_influence/,"In online discussion forums, users are more motivated to take part in discussions when observing other users’ participation — the effect of social influence among forum users. In this paper, we study how to utilize social influence for increasing user participation in online forums. To do so, we propose the use of sidebars, which display forum threads to users, as a mechanism to maximize user influence and boost participation. We formally define the participation maximization problem with the sidebar mechanism, based on the social influence network. We show that it is a special instance of the social welfare maximization problem with submodular utility functions and it is NP-hard. However, generic approximation algorithms for social welfare maximization is too slow to be feasible for real-world forums. Thus we design a heuristic algorithm, named Thread Allocation Based on Influence (TABI), to tackle the problem. Through extensive experiments using a dataset from a real-world online forum, we demonstrate that TABI consistently outperforms all other algorithms, including a personalized recommendation algorithm, in increasing forum participation. The results of this work could facilitate other related studies such as designs for recommendation systems. The problem of participation maximization based on influence also opens a new direction in the study of social influence. Moreover, the proposed techniques can be applied to other social media, e.g., to maximize overall attention for advertisement in Facebook."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_conover_polarization/,"In this study we investigate how social media shape the networked public sphere and facilitate communication between communities with different political orientations. We examine two networks of political communication on Twitter, comprised of more than 250,000 tweets from the six weeks leading up to the 2010 U.S. congressional midterm elections. Using a combination of network clustering algorithms and manually-annotated data we demonstrate that the network of political retweets exhibits a highly segregated partisan structure, with extremely limited connectivity between left- and right-leaning users. Surprisingly this is not the case for the user-to-user mention network, which is dominated by a single politically heterogeneous cluster of users in which ideologically-opposed individuals interact at a much higher rate compared to the network of retweets. To explain the distinct topologies of the retweet and mention networks we conjecture that politically motivated individuals provoke interaction by injecting partisan content into information streams whose primary audience consists of ideologically-opposed users.We conclude with statistical evidence in support of this hypothesis."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_livne_election/,"In this work, we study the use of Twitter by House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates during the midterm (2010) elections in the U.S. Our data includes almost 700 candidates and over 690k documents that they produced and cited in the 3.5 years leading to the elections. We utilize graph and text mining techniques to analyze differences between Democrats, Republicans and Tea Party candidates, and suggest a novel use of language modeling for estimating content cohesiveness. Our findings show significant differences in the usage patterns of social media, and suggest conservative candidates used this medium more effectively, conveying a coherent message and maintaining a dense graph of connections. Despite the lack of party leadership, we find Tea Party members display both structural and language-based cohesiveness. Finally, we investigate the relation between network structure, content and election results by creating a proof-of-concept model that predicts candidate victory with an accuracy of 88.0%."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_munson_prevalence/,"Though political theorists have emphasized the importance of political discussion in non-political spaces, past study of online political discussion has focused on primarily political websites. Using a random sample from Blogger.com, we find that 25% of all political posts are from blogs that post about politics less than 20% of the time, because the vast majority of blogs post about politics some of the time but infrequently. Far from being taboo topics in those nonpolitical blogs, political posts got slightly more comments than non-political posts in those same blogs, and the comments overwhelmingly engage the political topics of the post, mostly agreeing but frequently disagreeing as well. We argue that non-political spaces devoted primarily to personal diaries, hobbies, and other topics represent a substantial place of online political discussion and should be a site for further study."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_an_conventions/,"We present a preliminary but groundbreaking study of the media landscape of Twitter. We use public data on whom follows who to uncover common behaviour in media consumption, the relationship between various classes of media, and the diversity of media content which social links may bring. Our analysis shows that there is a non-negligible amount of indirect media exposure, either through friends who follow particular media sources, or via retweeted messages. We show that the indirect media exposure expands the political diversity of news to which users are exposed to a surprising extent, increasing the range by between 60-98%. These results are valuable because they have not been readily available to traditional media, and they can help predict how we will read news, and how publishers will interact with us in the future."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_mesquita_blogosphere/,"Information extraction systems have been recently proposed for organizing and exploring content in large online text corpora as information networks. In such networks, the nodes are named entities (e.g., people, organizations) while the edges correspond to statements indicating relations among such entities. To date, such systems extract rather primitive networks, capturing only those relations which are expressed by direct statements. In many applications, it is useful to also extract more subtle relations which are often expressed as meta statements in the text. These can, for instance provide the context for a statement (e.g., “Google acquired YouTube on October 2006”), or repercussion about a statement (e.g., “The US condemned Russia’s invasion of Georgia”). In this work, we report on a system for extracting relations expressed in both direct statements as well as in meta statements. We propose a method based on Conditional Random Fields that explores syntactic features to extract both kinds of statements seamlessly. We follow the Open Information Extraction paradigm, where a classifier is trained to recognize any type of relation instead of specific ones. Finally, our results show substantial improvements over a state-of-the-art information extraction system, both in terms of accuracy and, especially, recall."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_hurlock_chaff/,"Within the millions of digital communications posted in online social networks, there is undoubtedly some valuable and useful information. Although a large portion of social media content is considered to be babble, research shows that people share useful links, provide recommendations to friends, answer questions, and solve problems. In this paper, we report on a qualitative investigation into the different factors that make tweets ‘useful’ and ‘not useful’ for a set of common search tasks. The investigation found 16 features that help make a tweet useful, noting that useful tweets often showed 2 or 3 of these features. ‘Not useful’ tweets, however, typically had only one of 17 clear and striking features. Further, we saw that these features can be weighted as according to different types of search tasks. Our results contribute a novel framework for extracting useful information from real-time streams of social-media content that will be used in the design of a future retrieval system."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_lee_detection/,"Twitter, as a form of social media, is fast emerging in recent years. Users are using Twitter to report real-life events. This paper focuses on detecting those events by analyzing the text stream in Twitter. Although event detection has long been a research topic, the characteristics of Twitter make it a non- trivial task. Tweets reporting such events are usually overwhelmed by high flood of meaningless ""babbles"". Moreover, event detection algorithm needs to be scalable given the sheer amount of tweets. This paper attempts to tackle these challenges with EDCoW (Event Detection with Clustering of Wavelet-based Signals). EDCoW builds signals for individual words by applying wavelet analysis on the frequency-based raw signals of the words. It then filters away the trivial words by looking at their corresponding signal auto- correlations. The remaining words are then clustered to form events with a modularity-based graph partitioning technique. Experimental studies show promising result of EDCoW. We also present the design of a proof-of-concept system, which was used to analyze netizens' online discussion about Singapore General Election 2011."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_counts_microblog/,"Bias can be defined as selective favoritism exhibited by human beings when posed with a task of decision making across multiple options. Online communities present plenty of decision making opportunities to their users. Users exhibit biases in their attachments, voting and ratings and other tasks of decision making. We study bias amongst microblog users due to the value of an author’s name. We describe the relationship between name value bias and number of followers, and cluster authors and readers based on patterns of bias they receive and exhibit, respectively. For authors we show that content from known names (e.g., @CNN) is rated artificially high, while content from unknown names is rated artificially low. For readers, our results indicate that there are two types: slightly biased, heavily biased. A subsequent analysis of Twitter author names revealed attributes of names that underlie this bias, including effects for gender, type of name (individual versus organization), and degree of topical relevance. We discuss how our work can be instructive to content distributors and search engines in leveraging and presenting microblog content."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_kramer_dimensions/,"We describe the dimensions along which Facebook users tend to express themselves via status updates using the semiautomated text analysis approach, the Meaning Extraction Method (MEM). First, we examined dimensions of selfexpression in all status updates from a sample of four million Facebook users from four English-speaking countries (the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia) in order to examine how these countries vary in their selfexpressions. All four countries showed a basic threecomponent structure, indicating that the medium is a stronger influence than country characteristics or demographics on how people use Facebook status updates. In each country, people vary in terms of the extent to which they use Informal Speech, share Positive Events, and discuss School in their Facebook status updates. Together, these factors tell us how users differ in their self-expression, and thus illustrate meaningful use cases for the product: Talking about what’s going on tends to be positive, and people vary in terms of the extent to which their status updates are short, slangy emotional expressions and topics regarding school. The specific words that define these factors showed subtle differences across countries: The use of profanity indicates fewer school words (but only in Australia), whereas the UK shows greater use of slang terms (rather than profanity) when speaking informally. The MEM also identified English-language dialects as a meaningful dimension along which the countries varied. In sum, beyond simply indicating topicality of posts, this study provides insight into how status updates are used for selfexpression. We discuss several theoretical frameworks that could produce these results, and more broadly discuss the generation of theoretical frameworks from wholly empirical data (such as naturalistic Internet speech) using the MEM."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_bakshy_allocate/,"An individual’s personal network — their set of social contacts—is a basic object of study in sociology. Studies of personal networks have focused on their size (the number of contacts) and their composition (in terms of categories such as kin and co-workers). Here we propose a new measure for the analysis of personal networks, based on the way in which an individual divides his or her attention across contacts. This allows us to contrast people who focus a large fraction of their interactions on a small set of close friends with people who disperse their attention more widely. Using data from Facebook, we find that this balance of attention is a relatively stable property of an individual over time, and that it displays interesting variation across both different groups of people and different modes of interaction. In particular, activities based on communication involve a much higher focus of attention than activities based simply on observation, and these two types of modalities also exhibit different forms of variation in interaction patterns both within and across groups. Finally, we contrast the amount of attention paid by individuals to their most frequent contacts with the rate of change in the identities of these contacts, providing a measure of churn for this set."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_hasler_poverty/,"This paper presents an ongoing investigation into how people use the Internet in an attempt to escape situations of information poverty. We consider posts from a variety of newsgroups which indicate that individuals feel they have nowhere else to go to find information or support for concerns crucial to their everyday lives. A qualitative content analysis is performed to examine three main issues: what information needs people posting to these groups have, who they hide these needs from in the ‘real world’, and why they feel they can only express their needs online. Preliminary findings show that information on health and relationships is most commonly sought. Needs are most often hidden from parents and family, and the main reasons for seeking information online are a lack of understanding and the fact that people simply don’t know where else to go. Our work confirms that newsgroups provide a means of expression for those who feel they have no local support available to them."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_masli_volunteer/,"In social production communities, users’ individual and collective efforts lead to the creation of valuable resources – cf. Wikipedia, Open Street Map, and Reddit. Contributors to such communities often specialize in the tasks they choose to do. We found evidence for specialization by work type in Cyclopath, a geographic wiki for bicyclists – most users edit a single type of map feature, such as points of interest or roads and trails. We also saw a user lifecycle effect: as users gain experience, they specialize in editing roads and trails. Our ﬁndings suggest more effective ways to organize social production interfaces, compose units of work, and match them to users who want to help."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_laniado_structure/,"Talk pages play a fundamental role in Wikipedia as the place for discussion and communication. In this work we use the comments on these pages to extract and study three networks, corresponding to different kinds of interactions.We find evidence of a specific assortativity profile which differentiates article discussions from personal conversations. An analysis of the tree structure of the article talk pages allows to capture patterns of interaction, and reveals structural differences among the discussions about articles from different semantic areas."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_bernstein_ephemerality/,"We present two studies of online ephemerality and anonymity based on the popular discussion board /b/ at 4chan.org: a website with over 7 million users that plays an influential role in Internet culture. Although researchers and practitioners often assume that user identity and data permanence are central tools in the design of online communities, we explore how /b/ succeeds despite being almost entirely anonymous and extremely ephemeral. We begin by describing /b/ and performing a content analysis that suggests the community is dominated by playful exchanges of images and links. Our first study uses a large dataset of more than five million posts to quantify ephemerality in /b/. We find that most threads spend just five seconds on the first page and less than five minutes on the site before expiring. Our second study is an analysis of identity signals on 4chan, finding that over 90% of posts are made by fully anonymous users, with other identity signals adopted and discarded at will. We describe alternative mechanisms that /b/ participants use to establish status and frame their interactions."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_keegan_clandestine/,Gold farming and real money trade refer to a set of illicit practices in massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) whereby players accumulate virtual resources to sell for “real world” money. Prior work has examined trade relationships formed by gold farmers but not the trust relationships which exist between members of these organizations. We adopt a hypergraph approach to model the multi-modal relationships of gold farmers granting other players permission to use and modify objects they own. We argue these permissions reflect underlying trust relationships which can be analyzed using network analysis methods. We compare farmers’ trust networks to the trust networks of both unidentified farmers and typical players. Our results demonstrate that gold farmers’ networks are different from trust networks of normal players whereby farmers trust highly-central non-farmer players but not each other. These findings have implications for augmenting detection methods and re-evaluating theories of clandestine behavior.
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_gosling_ambiance/,"Recently, several online social networking sites (OSNs; e.g., FourSquare) have emerged that allow people to record and broadcast their presence at physical locations. We examined the viability of using images of frequent patrons listed on an establishment’s FourSquare page to infer the ambiance of the establishment. In Study 1, 10 judges independently rated 25 bars and 24 cafes in Austin, Texas. Ratings were based on the profile pictures of 25 randomly selected persons who frequented each establishment. Ratings tapped ambient physical and psychological qualities (e.g., loud, creepy), typical-patron personalities (e.g., extraverted), and likely patron activities (e.g., dancing). Results indicated considerable inter-judge consensus across the attributes rated (mean ICCs averaged .32, .69. and .33 for the ambiance, patronpersonality, and patron-activity variables respectively). In Study 2, a second team of 10 observers visited each target establishment during business hours and rated each location on the same set of variables. These ratings also showed strong inter-judge consensus (mean ICCs averaged .69, .79. and .62 for the ambiance, patron-personality, and patronactivity variables respectively). Correlations between the ratings obtained in Studies 1 and 2 showed surprisingly strong convergence suggesting that the profile photos conveyed valid information about the target establishments."
