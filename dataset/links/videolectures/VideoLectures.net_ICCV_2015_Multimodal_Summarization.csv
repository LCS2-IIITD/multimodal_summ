http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_boyd_convex_optimization/,"We introduce a convex optimization modeling framework that transforms a convex optimization problem expressed in a form natural and convenient for the user into an equivalent cone program in a way that preserves fast linear transforms in the original problem. By representing linear functions in the transformation process not as matrices, but as graphs that encode composition of abstract linear operators, we arrive at a matrix-free cone program, i.e., one whose data matrix is represented by an abstract linear operator and its adjoint. This cone program can then be solved by a matrix-free cone solver. By combining the matrix-free modeling framework and cone solver, we obtain a general method for efficiently solving convex optimization problems involving fast linear transforms"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_malinowski_your_neurons/,"We address a question answering task on real-world images that is set up as a Visual Turing Test. By combining latest advances in image representation and natural language processing, we propose Neural-Image-QA, an end-to-end formulation to this problem for which all parts are trained jointly. In contrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where the language output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language input (image and question). Our approach Neural Image-QA doubles the performance of the previous best approach on this problem. We provide additional insights into the problem by analyzing how much information is contained only in the language part for which we provide a new human baseline. To study human consensus, which is related to the ambiguities inherent in this challenging task, we propose two novel metrics and collect additional answers which extends the original DAQUAR dataset to DAQUAR-Consensus"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_divvala_semantic_segmentation/,"We introduce Segment-Phrase Table (SPT), a large collection of bijective associations between textual phrases and their corresponding segmentations. Leveraging recent progress in object recognition and natural language semantics, we show how we can successfully build a high-quality segment-phrase table using minimal human supervision. More importantly, we demonstrate the unique value unleashed by this rich bimodal resource, for both vision as well as natural language understanding. First, we show that fine-grained textual labels facilitate contextual reasoning that helps in satisfying semantic constraints across image segments. This feature enables us to achieve state-of-the-art segmentation results on benchmark datasets. Next, we show that the association of high-quality segmentations to textual phrases aids in richer semantic understanding and reasoning of these textual phrases. Leveraging this feature, we motivate the problem of visual entailment and visual paraphrasing, and demonstrate its utility on a large dataset"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_zhu_aligning_books/,"Books are a rich source of both fine-grained information, how a character, an object or a scene looks like, as well as high-level semantics, what someone is thinking, feeling and how these states evolve through a story. This paper aims to align books to their movie releases in order to provide rich descriptive explanations for visual content that go semantically far beyond the captions available in current datasets. To align movies and books we exploit a neural sentence embedding that is trained in an unsupervised way from a large corpus of books, as well as a video-text neural embedding for computing similarities between movie clips and sentences in the book. We propose a context-aware CNN to combine information from multiple sources. We demonstrate good quantitative performance for movie/book align- ment and show several qualitative examples that showcase the diversity of tasks our model can be used for."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_yao_image_similarities/,"One of the fundamental problems in image search is to learn the ranking functions, i.e., similarity between the query and image. The research on this topic has evolved through two paradigms: feature-based vector model and image ranker learning. The former relies on the image surrounding texts, while the latter learns a ranker based on human labeled query-image pairs. Each of the paradigms has its own limitation. The vector model is sensitive to the quality of text descriptions, and the learning paradigm is difficult to be scaled up as human labeling is always too expensive to obtain. We demonstrate in this paper that the above two limitations can be well mitigated by jointly exploring subspace learning and the use of click-through data. Specifically, we propose a novel Ranking Canonical Correlation Analysis (RCCA) for learning query and image similarities. RCCA initially finds a common subspace between query and image views by maximizing their correlations, and further simultaneously learns a bilinear query-image similarity function and adjusts the subspace to preserve the preference relations implicit in the click-through data. Once the subspace is finalized, query-image similarity can be computed by the bilinear similarity function on their mappings in this subspace. On a large-scale click-based image dataset with 11.7 million queries and one million images, RCCA is shown to be powerful for image search with superior performance over several state-of-the-art methods on both keyword-based and query-by-example tasks."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_ikehata_indoor_modeling/,"This paper presents a novel 3D modeling framework that reconstructs an indoor scene as a structured model from panorama RGBD images. A scene geometry is represented as a graph, where nodes correspond to structural elements such as rooms, walls, and objects. The approach devises a structure grammar that defines how a scene graph can be manipulated. The grammar then drives a principled new reconstruction algorithm, where the grammar rules are sequentially applied to recover a structured model. The paper also proposes a new room segmentation algorithm and an offset-map reconstruction algorithm that are used in the framework and can enforce architectural shape priors far beyond existing state-of-the-art. The structured scene representation enables a variety of novel applications, ranging from indoor scene visualization, automated floorplan generation, Inverse-CAD, and more. We have tested our framework and algorithms on six synthetic and five real datasets with qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The sourcecode and the data are available at the project website."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_martin_brualla_internet_photos/,"Given an Internet photo collection of a landmark, we compute a 3D time-lapse video sequence where a virtual camera moves continuously in time and space. While previous work assumed a static camera, the addition of camera motion during the time-lapse creates a very compelling impression of parallax. Achieving this goal, however, requires addressing multiple technical challenges, including solving for time-varying depth maps, regularizing 3D point color profiles over time, and reconstructing high quality, hole-free images at every frame from the projected profiles. Our results show photorealistic time-lapses of skylines and natural scenes over many years, with dramatic parallax effects"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_ummenhofer_multiscale_reconstruction/,"We present a variational approach for surface reconstruction from a set of oriented points with scale information. We focus particularly on scenarios with non-uniform point densities due to images taken from different distances. In contrast to previous methods, we integrate the scale information in the objective and globally optimize the signed distance function of the surface on a balanced octree grid. We use a finite element discretization on the dual structure of the octree minimizing the number of variables. The tetrahedral mesh is generated efficiently from the dual structure, and also memory efficiency is optimized, such that robust data terms can be used even on very large scenes. The surface normals are explicitly optimized and used for surface extraction to improve the reconstruction at edges and corners"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_tal_point_clouds/,"Is it possible to determine the visible subset of points directly from a given point cloud?  Interestingly, in [7] it was  shown  that  this  is  indeed  the  case—despite  the  fact that points cannot occlude each other, this task can be performed without surface reconstruction or normal estimation. The operator is very simple—it first transforms the points  to  a  new  domain  and  then  constructs  the  convex hull in that domain.  Points that lie on the convex hull of the transformed set of points are the images of the visible points. This operator found numerous applications in computer vision, including face reconstruction, keypoint detection, finding the best viewpoints, reduction of points, and many more.   The current paper addresses a fundamental question:  What properties should a transformation function satisfy,  in order to be utilized in this operator? We show that three such properties are sufficient—the sign of the function, monotonicity, and a condition regarding the function’s parameter. The correctness of an algorithm that satisfies these three properties is proved.  Finally, we show an interesting application of the operator—assignment of visibility-confidence score. This feature is missing from previous approaches, where a binary yes/no visibility is determined.  This score can be utilized in various applications; we illustrate its use in view-dependent curvature estimation"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_rahimi_supervised_graph/,"We present a weakly-supervised approach to semantic segmentation. The goal is to assign pixel-level labels given only partial information, for example, image-level labels. This is an important problem in many application scenarios where it is difficult to get accurate segmentation or not feasible to obtain detailed annotations. The proposed approach starts with an initial coarse segmentation, followed by a spectral clustering approach that groups related image parts into communities. A community-driven graph is then constructed that captures spatial and feature relationships between communities while a label graph captures correlations between image labels. Finally, mapping the image level labels to appropriate communities is formulated as a convex optimization problem. The proposed approach does not require location information for image level labels and can be trained using partially labeled datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches, we achieve a significant performance improvement of 9% on MSRC-21 dataset and 11% on LabelMe dataset, while being more than 300 times faster."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_yu_image_segmentation/,"Image segmentation is a critical step in many computer vision tasks, including high-level visual recognition and scene understanding as well as low-level photo and video processing.  In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear embedding, called piecewise flat embedding, for image segmentation. Based on the theory of sparse signal recovery, piecewise flat embedding attempts to identify segment boundaries while significantly suppressing variations within segments. We adopt an L1-regularized energy term in the formulation to promote sparse solutions. We further devise an effective two-stage numerical algorithm based on Bregman iterations to solve the proposed embedding. Piecewise flat embedding can be easily integrated into existing image segmentation frameworks, including segmentation based on spectral clustering and hierarchical segmentation based on contour detection.  Experiments on BSDS500 indicate that segmentation algorithms incorporating this embedding can achieve significantly improved results in both frameworks."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_liu_li_image_segmentation/,"This paper addresses semantic image segmentation by incorporating rich information into Markov Random Field (MRF), including high-order relations and mixture of label contexts. Unlike previous works that optimized MRFs using iterative algorithm, we solve MRF by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely Deep Parsing Network (DPN) 1, which enables deterministic end-to-end computation in a single forward pass.  Specifically, DPN extends a contemporary CNN architecture to model unary terms and additional layers are carefully devised to approximate the mean field algorithm (MF) for pairwise terms. It has several appealing properties. First, different from the recent works that combined CNN and MRF, where many iterations of MF were required for each training image during back-propagation, DPN is able to achieve high performance by approximating one iteration of MF. Second, DPN represents various types of pairwise terms, making many existing works as its special cases. Third, DPN makes MF easier to be parallelized and speeded up in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). DPN is thoroughly evaluated on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, where a single DPN model yields a new state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy of 77.5%"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_liang_human_parsing/,"In this work, we address the human parsing task with a novel Contextualized Convolutional Neural Network (Co-CNN) architecture, which well integrates the cross-layer context, global image-level context, within-super-pixel context and cross-super-pixel neighborhood context into a unified network. Given an input human image, Co-CNN produces the pixel-wise categorization in an end-to-end way. First, the cross-layer context is captured by our basic local-to-global-to-local structure, which hierarchically combines the global semantic information and the local fine details across different convolutional layers. Second, the global image-level label prediction is used as an auxiliary objective in the intermediate layer of the Co-CNN, and its outputs are further used for guiding the feature learning in subsequent convolutional layers to leverage the global image-level context. Finally, to further utilize the local super-pixel contexts, the within-super-pixel smoothing and cross-super-pixel neighbourhood voting are formulated as natural subcomponents of the Co-CNN to achieve the local label consistency in both training and testing process. Comprehensive evaluations on two public datasets well demonstrate the significant superiority of our Co-CNN over other state-of- the-arts for human parsing. In particular, the F-1 score on the large dataset [15] reaches 76.95% by Co-CNN, significantly higher than 62.81% and 64.38% by the state-of-the-art algorithms, M-CNN [21] and ATR [15], respectively."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_xie_edge_detection/,"We develop a new edge detection algorithm that addresses two important issues in this long-standing vision problem: (1) holistic image training and prediction; and (2) multi-scale and multi-level feature learning. Our proposed method, holistically-nested edge detection (HED), performs image-to-image prediction by means of a deep learning model that leverages fully convolutional neural networks and deeply-supervised nets. HED automatically learns rich hierarchical representations (guided by deep supervision on side responses) that are important in order to resolve the challenging ambiguity in edge and object boundary detection. We significantly advance the state-of-the-art on the BSD500 dataset (ODS F-score of.782) and the NYU Depth dataset (ODS F-score of.746), and do so with an improved speed (0.4s per image) that is orders of magnitude faster than some recent CNN-based edge detection algorithms."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_sclaroff_object_detection/,"We propose a highly efficient, yet powerful, salient object detection method based on the Minimum Barrier Distance (MBD) Transform. The MBD transform is robust to pixel-value fluctuation, and thus can be effectively applied on raw pixels without region abstraction. We present an approximate MBD transform algorithm with 100X speedup over the exact algorithm. An error bound analysis is also provided. Powered by this fast MBD transform algorithm, the proposed salient object detection method runs at 80 FPS, and significantly outperforms previous methods with similar speed on four large benchmark datasets, and achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, a technique based on color whitening is proposed to extend our method to leverage the appearance-based backgroundness cue. This extended version further improves the performance, while still being one order of magnitude faster than all the other leading methods."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_jayaraman_image_representations/,"Understanding  how  images  of  objects  and  scenes  behave in response to specific ego-motions is a crucial aspect of proper visual development, yet existing visual learning methods are conspicuously disconnected from the physical source of their images.  We propose to exploit proprioceptive motor signals to provide unsupervised regularization in convolutional neural networks to learn visual representations from egocentric video.  Specifically, we enforce that our learned features exhibit equivariance i.e. they respond predictably to transformations associated with distinct ego-motions.  With three datasets, we show that our unsupervised feature learning approach significantly outperforms  previous  approaches  on  visual  recognition  and next-best-view  prediction  tasks. In  the  most  challenging test, we show that features learned from video captured on an autonomous driving platform improve large-scale scene recognition in static images from a disjoint domain."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_doersch_visual_representation/,"This work explores the use of spatial context as a source of free and plentiful supervisory signal for training a rich visual representation. Given only a large, unlabeled image collection, we extract random pairs of patches from each image and train a convolutional neural net to predict the position of the second patch relative to the first. We argue that doing well on this task requires the model to learn to recognize objects and their parts. We demonstrate that the feature representation learned using this within-image context indeed captures visual similarity across images. For example, this representation allows us to perform unsupervised visual discovery of objects like cats, people, and even birds from the Pascal VOC 2011 detection dataset. Furthermore, we show that the learned ConvNet can be used in the R-CNN framework [19] and provides a significant boost over a randomly-initialized ConvNet, resulting in state-of-the-art performance among algorithms which use only Pascal-provided training set annotations"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_chen_supervised_learning/,"We present an approach to utilize large amounts of web data for learning CNNs. Specifically inspired by curriculum learning, we present a two-step approach for CNN training. First, we use easy images to train an initial visual representation. We then use this initial CNN and adapt it to harder, more realistic images by leveraging the structure of data and categories. We demonstrate that our two-stage CNN outperforms a fine-tuned CNN trained on ImageNet on Pascal VOC 2012. We also demonstrate the strength of webly supervised learning by localizing objects in web images and training a R-CNN style [19] detector. It achieves the best performance on VOC 2007 where no VOC training data is used. Finally, we show our approach is quite robust to noise and performs comparably even when we use image search results from March 2013 (pre-CNN image search era)."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_girshick_fast_r_cnn/,"This paper proposes a Fast Region-based Convolutional Network method (Fast R-CNN) for object detection. Fast R-CNN builds on previous work to efficiently classify object proposals using deep convolutional networks.  Compared to previous work, Fast R-CNN employs several innovations to improve training and testing speed while also increasing detection accuracy. Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9×faster than R-CNN, is 213×faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3×faster, tests 10×faster, and is more accurate. Fast R-CNN is implemented in Python and C++ (using Caffe) and is available under the open-source MIT License at https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_lin_visual_recognition/,"We propose bilinear models, a recognition architecture that consists of two feature extractors whose outputs are multiplied using outer product at each location of the image and pooled to obtain an image descriptor. This architecture can model local pairwise feature interactions in a translationally invariant manner which is particularly useful for fine-grained categorization. It also generalizes various orderless texture descriptors such as the Fisher vector, VLAD and O2P. We present experiments with bilinear models where the feature extractors are based on convolutional neural networks. The bilinear form simplifies gradient computation and allows end-to-end training of both networks using image labels only. Using networks initialized from the ImageNet dataset followed by domain specific fine-tuning we obtain 84.1% accuracy of the CUB-200-2011 dataset requiring only category labels at training time. We present experiments and visualizations that analyze the effects of fine-tuning and the choice two networks on the speed and accuracy of the models. Results show that the architecture compares favorably to the existing state of the art on a number of fine-grained datasets while being substantially simpler and easier to train. More over, our most accurate model is fairly efficient running at 8 frames/sec on a NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPU. The source code for the complete system will be made available at http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/bcnn"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_xiao_relative_attributes/,"We present a weakly-supervised approach that discovers the spatial extent of relative attributes, given only pairs of ordered images. In contrast to traditional approaches that use global appearance features or rely on keypoint detectors, our goal is to automatically discover the image regions that are relevant to the attribute, even when the attribute’s appearance changes drastically across its attribute spectrum. To accomplish this, we first develop a novel formulation that combines a detector with local smoothness to discover a set of coherent visual chains across the image collection. We then introduce an efficient way to generate additional chains anchored on the initial discovered ones. Finally, we automatically identify the most relevant visual chains, and create an ensemble image representation to model the attribute. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our method’s promise relative to several baselines in modeling relative attributes."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_kontschieder_decision_forests/,"We present Deep Neural Decision Forests – a novel approach that unifies classification trees with the representation learning functionality known from deep convolutional networks, by training them in an end-to-end manner. To combine these two worlds, we introduce a stochastic and differentiable decision tree model, which steers the representation learning usually conducted in the initial layers of a (deep) convolutional network. Our model differs from conventional deep networks because a decision forest provides the final predictions and it differs from conventional decision forests since we propose a principled, joint and global optimization of split and leaf node parameters. We show experimental results on benchmark machine learning datasets like MNIST and ImageNet and find on par or superior results when compared to state-of-the-art deep models. Most remarkably, we obtain Top5-Errors of only 7.84%/6.38% on ImageNet validation data when integrating our forests in a single-crop, single/seven model GoogLeNet architecture, respectively. Thus, even without any form of training data set augmentation we are improving on the 6.67% error obtained by the best GoogLeNet architecture (7 models, 144 crops)."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_yang_fried_convnets/,"The fully- connected layers of deep convolutional neural networks typically contain over 90% of the network parameters. Reducing the number of parameters while preserving predictive performance is critically important for training big models in distributed systems and for deployment in embedded devices. In this paper, we introduce a novel Adaptive Fastfood transform to reparameterize the matrix-vector multiplication of fully connected layers.  Reparameterizing a fully connected layer with d inputs and n outputs with the Adaptive Fastfood transform reduces the storage and computational costs costs from O(nd) to O(n) and O(n log d) respectively. Using the Adaptive Fastfood transform in convolutional networks results in what we call a deep fried convnet. These convnets are end-to-end trainable, and enable us to attain substantial reductions in the number of parameters without affecting prediction accuracy on the MNIST and ImageNet datasets."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_murdock_component_analysis/,"Unsupervised and weakly-supervised visual learning in large image collections are critical in order to avoid the time-consuming and error-prone process of manual labeling. Standard approaches rely on methods like multiple-instance learning or graphical models, which can be computationally intensive and sensitive to initialization. On the other hand, simpler component analysis or clustering methods usually cannot achieve meaningful invariances or semantic interpretability. To address the issues of previous work, we present a simple but effective method called Semantic Component Analysis (SCA), which provides a decomposition of images into semantic components. Unsupervised SCA decomposes additive image representations into spatially-meaningful visual components that naturally correspond to object categories. Using an overcomplete representation that allows for rich instance-level constraints and spatial priors, SCA gives improved results and more interpretable components in comparison to traditional matrix factorization techniques. If weakly-supervised information is available in the form of image-level tags, SCA factorizes a set of images into semantic groups of superpixels. We also provide qualitative connections to traditional methods for component analysis (e.g.Grassmann av-erages, PCA, and NMF). The effectiveness of our approach is validated through synthetic data and on the MSRC2 and Sift Flow datasets, demonstrating competitive results in unsupervised and weakly-supervised semantic segmentation."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_cao_matrix_factorization/,"Many computer vision problems can be posed as learning a low-dimensional subspace from high dimensional data. The low rank matrix factorization (LRMF) represents a commonly utilized subspace learning strategy. Most of the current LRMF techniques are constructed on the optimization problem using L1 norm and L2 norm, which mainly deal with Laplacian and Gaussian noise, respectively. To make LRMF capable of adapting more complex noise, this paper proposes a new LRMF model by assuming noise as Mixture of Exponential Power (MoEP) distributions and proposes a penalized MoEP model by combining the penalized likelihood method with MoEP distributions. Such setting facilitates the learned LRMF model capable of automatically fitting the real noise through MoEP distributions. Each component in this mixture is adapted from a series of preliminary super- or sub-Gaussian candidates. An Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is also designed to infer the parameters involved in the proposed PMoEP model. The advantage of our method is demonstrated by extensive experiments on synthetic data, face modeling and hyperspectral image restoration."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_kalantidis_image_clustering/,"Large scale duplicate detection, clustering and mining of documents or images has been conventionally treated with seed detection via hashing, followed by seed growing heuristics using fast search. Principled clustering methods, especially kernelized and spectral ones, have higher complexity and are difficult to scale above millions. Under the assumption of documents or images embedded in Euclidean space, we revisit recent advances in approximate k-means variants, and borrow their best ingredients to introduce a new one, inverted-quantized k-means(IQ-means). Key underlying concepts are quantization of data points and multi-index based inverted search from centroids to cells. Its quantization is a form of hashing and analogous to seed detection, while its updates are analogous to seed growing, yet principled in the sense of distortion minimization. We further design a dynamic variant that is able to determine the number of clusters k in a single run at nearly zero additional cost. Combined with powerful deep learned representations, we achieve clustering of a 100 million image collection on a single machine in less than one hour."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_xia_outlier_removal/,"We study the problem of automatically removing outliers from noisy data, with application for removing outlier images from an image collection. We address this problem by utilizing the reconstruction errors of an autoencoder. We observe that when data are reconstructed from low-dimensional representations, the inliers and the outliers can be well separated according to their reconstruction errors. Based on this basic observation, we gradually inject discriminative information in the learning process of autoencoder to make the inliers and the outliers more separable. Experiments on a variety of image datasets validate our approach."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_ploetz_registering_images/,"Many existing approaches for image-to-geometry registration assume that either a textured 3D model or a good initial guess of the 3D pose is available to bootstrap the registration process. In this paper we consider the registration of photographs to 3D models even when no texture information is available. This is very challenging as we cannot rely on texture gradients, and even shading gradients are hard to estimate since the lighting conditions are unknown. To that end, we propose average shading gradients, a rendering technique that estimates the average gradient magnitude over all lighting directions under Lambertian shading. We use this gradient representation as the building block of a registration pipeline based on matching sparse features. To cope with inevitable false matches due to the missing texture information and to increase robustness, the pose of the 3D model is estimated in two stages. Coarse pose hypotheses are first obtained from a single correct match each, subsequently refined using SIFT flow, and finally verified. We apply our algorithm to registering images of real-world objects to untextured 3D meshes of limited accuracy."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_chen_convex_optimization/,"We present an approach to nonrigid registration of 3D surfaces. We cast isometric  embedding  as  MRF  optimization and apply efficient global optimization algorithms based on linear programming relaxations. The Markov random field perspective suggests a natural connection with robust statistics and motivates robust forms of the intrinsic distortion functional.   Our approach outperforms a large body of prior work by a significant margin, increasing registration precision on real data by a factor of 3."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_pani_pudel_image_sets/,"This paper deals with the problem of registering a known structured 3D scene and its metric Structure-from-Motion (SfM) counterpart. The proposed work relies on a prior plane segmentation of the 3D scene and aligns the data obtained from both modalities by solving the point-to-plane assignment problem. An inliers-maximization approach within a Branch-and-Bound (BnB) search scheme is adopted. For the first time in this paper, a Sum-of-Squares optimization theory framework is employed for identifying point-to-plane mismatches (i.e. outliers) with certainty. This allows us to iteratively build potential inliers sets and converge to the solution satisfied by the largest number of point-to-plane assignments. Furthermore, our approach is boosted by new plane visibility conditions which are also introduced in this paper. Using this framework, we solve the registration problem in two cases: (i) a set of putative point-to-plane correspondences (with possibly overwhelmingly many outliers) is given as input and (ii) no initial correspondences are given. In both cases, our approach yields outstanding results in terms of robustness and optimality."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_zhang_global_stereo/,"We present a novel global stereo model designed for view interpolation. Unlike existing stereo models which only output a disparity map, our model is able to output a 3D triangular mesh, which can be directly used for view interpolation. To this aim, we partition the input stereo images into 2D triangles with shared vertices. Lifting the 2D triangulation to 3D naturally generates a corresponding mesh. A technical difficulty is to properly split vertices to multiple copies when they appear at depth discontinuous boundaries. To deal with this problem, we formulate our objective as a two-layer MRF, with the upper layer modeling the splitting properties of the vertices and the lower layer optimizing a region-based stereo matching. Experiments on the Middlebury and the Herodion datasets demonstrate that our model is able to synthesize visually coherent new view angles with high PSNR, as well as outputting high quality disparity maps which rank at the first place on the new challenging high resolution Middlebury 3.0 benchmark."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_zendel_computer_vision/,"Test data plays an important role in computer vision (CV) but is plagued by two questions: Which situations should be covered by the test data and have we tested enough to reach a conclusion? In this paper we propose a new solution answering these questions using a standard procedure devised by the safety community to validate complex systems: The Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP). It is designed to systematically search and identify difficult, performance-decreasing situations and aspects. We introduce a generic CV model that creates the basis for the hazard analysis and, for the first time, apply an extensive HAZOP to the CV domain. The result is a publicly available checklist with more than 900 identified individual hazards. This checklist can be used to evaluate existing test datasets by quantifying the amount of covered hazards. We evaluate our approach by first analyzing and annotating the popular stereo vision test datasets Middlebury and KITTI. Second, we compare the performance of six popular stereo matching algorithms at the identified hazards from our checklist with their average performance and show, as expected, a clear negative influence of the hazards.  The presented approach is a useful tool to evaluate and improve test datasets and creates a common basis for future dataset designs."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_su_feature_synthesis/,"Comparing two images from different views has been a long-standing challenging problem in computer vision, as visual features are not stable under large view point changes. In this paper, given a single input image of an object, we synthesize its features for other views, leveraging an existing modestly-sized 3D model collection of related but not identical objects.To accomplish this, we study the relationship of image patches between different views of the same object, seeking what we call surrogate patches — patches in one view whose feature content predicts well the features of a patch in another view. Based upon these surrogate relationships, we can create feature sets for all views of the latent object on a per patch basis, providing us an augmented multi-view representation of the object. We provide theoretical and empirical analysis of the feature synthesis process, and evaluate the augmented features in fine-grained image retrieval/recognition and instance retrieval tasks.  Experimental results show that our synthesized features do enable view-independent comparison between images and perform significantly better than other traditional approaches in this respect"
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_su_qi_viewpoint_estimation/,"Object viewpoint estimation from 2D images is an essential task in computer vision. However, two issues hinder its progress: scarcity of training data with viewpoint annotations, and a lack of powerful features. Inspired by the growing availability of 3D models, we propose a framework to address both issues by combining render-based image synthesis and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks). We believe that 3D models have the potential in generating a large number of images of high variation, which can be well exploited by deep CNN with a high learning capacity. Towards this goal, we propose a scalable and overfitresistant image synthesis pipeline, together with a novel CNN specifically tailored for the viewpoint estimation task. Experimentally, we show that the viewpoint estimation from our pipeline can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL 3D+ benchmark."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_wang_lost_shopping/,"In this paper we propose a novel approach to localization in very large indoor spaces (i.e., shopping malls with over 200 stores) that takes a single image and a floor plan of the environment as input.  We formulate the localization problem as inference in a Markov random field, which jointly reasons about text detection (localizing shop names in the image with precise bounding boxes), shop facade segmentation, as well as camera’s rotation and translation within the entire shopping mall. The power of our approach is that it does not use any prior information about appearance and instead exploits text detections corresponding to shop names as a cue for localization. This makes our method applicable to a variety of domains and robust to store appearance variation across countries, seasons, and illumination conditions. We demonstrate our approach on our new dataset spanning two very large shopping malls, and show the power of holistic reasoning."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_zeisl_pose_voting/,"Image-based localization approaches aim to determine the camera pose from which an image was taken. Finding correct 2D-3D correspondences between query image features and 3D points in the scene model becomes harder as the size of the model increases. Current state-of-the-art methods therefore combine elaborate matching schemes with camera pose estimation techniques that are able to handle large fractions of wrong matches.  In this work we study the benefits and limitations of spatial verification compared to appearance-based filtering. We propose a voting-based pose estimation strategy that exhibits O(n) complexity in the number of matches and thus facilitates to consider much more matches than previous approaches – whose complexity grows at least quadratically. This new outlier rejection formulation enables us to evaluate pose estimation for 1-to-many matches and to surpass the state-of-the-art. At the same time, we show that using more matches does not automatically lead to a better performance."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_oberweger_feedback_loop/,"We propose an entirely data-driven approach to estimating the 3D pose of a hand given a depth image. We show that we can correct the mistakes made by a Convolutional Neural Network trained to predict an estimate of the 3D pose by using a feedback loop. The components of this feedback loop are also Deep Networks, optimized using training data. They remove the need for fitting a 3D model to the input data, which requires both a carefully designed fitting function and algorithm. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and is efficient as our implementation runs at over 400 fps on a single GPU."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_taylor_hierarchical_sampling/,"We address the problem of hand pose estimation, formulated as an inverse problem. Typical approaches optimize an  energy  function  over  pose  parameters  using  a  ‘black box’ image generation procedure. This procedure knows little about either the relationships between the parameters or the form of the energy function. In this paper, we show that we can significantly improve upon black box optimization by exploiting high-level knowledge of the parameter structure and using a local surrogate energy function.  Our new framework, hierarchical sampling optimization, consists of a sequence of predictors organized into a kinematic hierarchy.  Each predictor is conditioned on its ancestors, and generates a set of samples over a subset of the pose parameters.  The highly-efficient surrogate energy is used to select among samples. Having evaluated the full hierarchy, the partial pose samples are concatenated to generate a full-pose hypothesis.  Several hypotheses are generated using the same procedure, and finally the original full energy function selects the best result. Experimental evaluation on three publically available datasets show that our method is particularly impressive in low-compute scenarios where it significantly outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_joo_panoptic_studio/,"We present an approach to capture the 3D structure and motion of a group of people engaged in a social interaction. The core challenges in capturing social interactions are: (1) occlusion is functional and frequent; (2) subtle motion needs to be measured over a space large enough to host a social group; and (3) human appearance and configuration variation is immense. The Panoptic Studio is a system organized around the thesis that social interactions should be measured through the perceptual integration of a large variety of view points. We present a modularized system designed around this principle, consisting of integrated structural, hardware, and software innovations. The system takes, as input, 480 synchronized video streams of multiple people engaged in social activities, and produces, as output, the labeled time-varying 3D structure of anatomical landmarks on individuals in the space. The algorithmic contributions include a hierarchical approach for generating skeletal trajectory proposals, and an optimization framework for skeletal reconstruction with trajectory re-association."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_berg_street_clothing/,"In this paper, we define a new task, Exact Street to Shop, where our goal is to match a real-world example of a garment item to the same item in an online shop. This is an extremely challenging task due to visual differences between street photos (pictures of people wearing clothing in everyday uncontrolled settings) and online shop photos (pictures of clothing items on people, mannequins, or in isolation, captured by professionals in more controlled settings). We collect a new dataset for this application containing 404,683 shop photos collected from 25 different online retailers and 20,357 street photos, providing a total of 39,479 clothing item matches between street and shop photos. We develop three different methods for Exact Street to Shop retrieval, including two deep learning baseline methods, and a method to learn a similarity measure between the street and shop domains. Experiments demonstrate that our learned similarity significantly outperforms our baselines that use existing deep learning based representations."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_chu_neural_network/,"In this paper, we propose to predict immediacy for interacting persons from still images. A complete immediacy set includes interactions, relative distance, body leaning direction and standing orientation. These measures are found to be related to the attitude, social relationship, social interaction, action, nationality, and religion of the communicators. A large-scale dataset with 10,000 images is constructed, in which all the immediacy cues and the human poses are annotated. We propose a rich set of immediacy representations that help to predict immediacy from imperfect 1-person and 2-person pose estimation results. A multi-task deep recurrent neural network is constructed to take the proposed rich immediacy representations as the input and learn the complex relationship among immediacy predictions through multiple steps of refinement. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved through extensive experiments on the large-scale dataset."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_cai_pedestrian_detection/,"The  design  of  complexity-aware  cascaded  detectors, combining features of very different complexities,  is considered. A new cascade design procedure is introduced, by formulating cascade learning as the Lagrangian optimization of a risk that accounts for both accuracy and complexity. A boosting algorithm, denoted as complexity aware cascade training (CompACT), is then derived to solve this optimization.  CompACT cascades are shown to seek an optimal trade-off between accuracy and complexity by pushing features of higher complexity to the later cascade stages, where only a few difficult candidate patches remain to be classified.  This enables the use of features of vastly different complexities in a single detector.  In result, the feature pool can be expanded to features previously impractical for cascade design, such as the responses of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). This is demonstrated through the design of a pedestrian detector with a pool of features whose complexities span orders of magnitude.  The resulting cascade generalizes the combination of a CNN with an object proposal mechanism:  rather than a pre-processing stage, CompACT cascades  seamlessly  integrate CNNs  in their stages. This enables state of the art performance on the Caltech and KITTI datasets, at fairly fast speeds."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_kadambi_polarization_cues/,"Coarse depth maps can be enhanced by using the shape information from polarization cues.  We propose a framework to combine surface normals from polarization (here-after polarization normals) with an aligned depth map. Polarization normals have not been used for depth enhancement before. This is because polarization normals suffer from physics-based artifacts, such as azimuthal ambiguity, refractive distortion and fronto-parallel signal degradation. We propose a framework to overcome these key challenges, allowing the benefits of polarization to be used to enhance depth maps. Our results demonstrate improvement with respect to state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction techniques."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_levis_cloud_tomography/,"We seek to sense the three dimensional (3D) volumetric distribution of scatterers in a heterogenous medium. An important case study for such a medium is the atmosphere. Atmospheric contents and their role in Earth’s radiation balance have significant uncertainties with regards to scattering components: aerosols and clouds. Clouds, made of water droplets, also lead to local effects as precipitation and shadows. Our sensing approach is computational tomography using passive multiangular imagery. For light-matter interaction that accounts for multiple-scattering, we use the 3D radiative transfer equation as a forward model. Volumetric recovery by inverting this model suffers from a computational bottleneck on large scales, which include many unknowns.  Steps taken make this tomography tractable, without approximating the scattering order or angle range."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_yago_vicente_kernel_optimization/,"The objective of this work is to detect shadows in images. We pose this as the problem of labeling image regions, where each region corresponds to a group of superpixels. To predict the label of each region, we train a kernel Least-Squares SVM for separating shadow and non-shadow regions. The parameters of the kernel and the classifier are jointly learned to minimize the leave-one-out cross validation error.   Optimizing the leave-one-out cross validation error is typically difficult, but it can be done efficiently in our framework.  Experiments on two challenging shadow datasets, UCF and UIUC, show that our region classifier outperforms more complex methods. We further enhance the performance of the region classifier by embedding it in an MRF framework and adding pairwise contextual cues. This leads to a method that significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_tan_removing_rain/,"Visual distortions on images caused by bad weather conditions can have a negative impact on the performance of many outdoor vision systems.  One often seen bad weather is rain which causes significant yet complex local intensity fluctuations in images. The paper aims at developing an effective algorithm to remove visual effects of rain from a single rain image,i.e. separate the rain layer and the derained image layer from a rain image.  Built upon a nonlinear generative model of rain image, namely screen blend model, we propose a dictionary learning based algorithm for single image de-raining.  The basic idea is to sparsely approximate the patches of two layers by very high discriminative codes over a learned dictionary with strong mutual exclusivity property. Such discriminative sparse codes lead to accurate separation of two layers from their non-linear composite. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the existing single image de-raining methods on tested rain images."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_shen_joint_filtering/,"Previous joint/guided filters directly transfer the structural information in the reference image to the target one. In this paper, we first analyze its major drawback – that is, there may be completely different edges in the two images. Simply passing all patterns to the target could introduce significant errors. To address this issue,  we propose the concept of mutual-structure, which refers to the structural information that is contained in both images and thus can be safely enhanced by joint filtering, and an untraditional objective function that can be efficiently optimized to yield mutual structure. Our method results in necessary and important edge preserving, which greatly benefits depth completion, optical flow estimation, image enhancement, stereo matching, to name a few."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_li_belief_propagation/,"Markov random fields are widely used to model many computer vision problems that can be cast in an energy minimization framework composed of unary and pairwise potentials. While computationally tractable discrete optimizers such as Graph Cuts and belief propagation (BP) exist for multi-label discrete problems, they still face prohibitively high computational challenges when the labels reside in a huge or very densely sampled space. Integrating key ideas from PatchMatch of effective particle propagation and resampling, PatchMatch belief propagation (PMBP) has been demonstrated to have good performance in addressing continuous labeling problems and runs orders of magnitude faster than Particle BP (PBP). However, the quality of the PMBP solution is tightly coupled with the local window size, over which the raw data cost is aggregated to mitigate ambiguity in the data constraint. This dependency heavily influences the overall complexity, increasing linearly with the window size. This paper proposes a novel algorithm called sped-up PMBP (SPM-BP) to tackle this critical computational bottleneck and speeds up PMBP by 50-100 times. The crux of SPM-BP is on unifying efficient filter-based cost aggregation and message passing with PatchMatch-based particle generation in a highly effective way. Though simple in its formulation, SPM-BP achieves superior performance for sub-pixel accurate stereo and optical-flow on benchmark datasets when compared with more complex and task-specific approaches."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_bailer_flow_fields/,"Modern large displacement optical flow algorithms usually use an initialization by either sparse descriptor matching techniques or dense approximate nearest neighbor fields. While the latter have the advantage of being dense, they have the major disadvantage of being very outlier prone as they are not designed to find the optical flow, but the visually most similar correspondence. In this paper we present a dense correspondence field approach that is much less outlier prone and thus much better suited for optical flow estimation than approximate nearest neighbor fields. Our approach is conceptually novel as it does not require explicit regularization, smoothing (like median filtering) or a new data term, but solely our novel purely data based search strategy that finds most inliers (even for small objects), while it effectively avoids finding outliers. Moreover, we present novel enhancements for outlier filtering.  We show that our approach is better suited for large displacement optical flow estimation than state-of-the-art descriptor matching techniques. We do so by initializing EpicFlow (so far the best method on MPI-Sintel) with our Flow Fields instead of their originally used state-of-the-art descriptor matching technique. We significantly outperform the original EpicFlow on MPI-Sintel, KITTI and Middlebury."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_valmadre_semantic_correspondence/,"Determining dense semantic correspondences across objects and scenes is a difficult problem that underpins many higher-level computer vision algorithms. Unlike canonical  dense  correspondence  problems  which  consider images that are spatially or temporally adjacent, semantic correspondence  is  characterized  by  images that share similar high-level structures whose exact appearance and geometry may differ. Motivated  by  object  recognition  literature  and  recent work on rapidly estimating linear classifiers,  we treat semantic correspondence as a constrained detection  problem,  where  an  exemplar  LDA  classifier  is learned for each pixel.  LDA classifiers have two distinct benefits:  (i) they exhibit higher average precision than similarity metrics typically used in correspondence problems,  and  (ii)  unlike  exemplar  SVM,  can  output globally interpretable posterior probabilities without calibration, whilst also being significantly faster to train. We  pose  the  correspondence  problem  as  a  graphical model, where the unary potentials are computed via convolution  with  the  set  of  exemplar  classifiers,  and the joint potentials enforce smoothly varying correspondence assignment."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_zhou_alternating_minimization/,"In this paper we propose a global optimization-based approach to jointly matching a set of images. The estimated correspondences simultaneously maximize pairwise feature affinities and cycle consistency across multiple images. Unlike previous convex methods relying on semidefinite programming, we formulate the problem as a low-rank matrix recovery problem and show that the desired semidefiniteness of a solution can be spontaneously fulfilled. The low-rank formulation enables us to derive a fast alternating minimization algorithm in order to handle practical problems with thousands of features. Both simulation and real experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a competitive performance with an order of magnitude speedup compared to the state of-the-art algorithm. In the end, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to match the images of different object instances and as a result the potential to reconstruct category-specific object models from those images."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_varadarajan_surveillance_videos/,"We present a novel approach for jointly estimating targets’ head, body orientations and conversational groups called F-formations from a distant social scene (e.g., a cocktail party captured by surveillance cameras). Differing from related works that have (i) coupled head and body pose learning by exploiting the limited range of orientations that the two can jointly take, or (ii) determined F-formations based on the mutual head (but not body) orientations of interactors, we present a unified framework to jointly infer both (i) and (ii). Apart from exploiting spatial and orientation relationships, we also integrate cues pertaining to temporal consistency and occlusions, which are beneficial while handling low-resolution data under surveillance settings. Efficacy of the joint inference framework reflects via increased head, body pose and F-formation estimation accuracy over the state-of-the-art, as confirmed by extensive experiments on two social datasets."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_soran_missing_actions/,"We all have experienced forgetting habitual actions among our daily activities. For example, we probably have forgotten to turn the lights off before leaving a room or turn the stove off after cooking. In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of issuing notifications on actions that may be missed. This involves learning about interdependencies between actions and being able to predict an ongoing action while segmenting the input video stream. In order to show a proof of concept, we collected a new egocentric dataset, in which people wear a camera while making lattes. We show promising results on the extremely challeng-ing task of issuing correct and timely reminders. We also show that our model reliably segments the actions, while predicting the ongoing one when only a few frames from the beginning of the action are observed. The overall prediction accuracy is 46.2% when only 10 frames of an action are seen (2/3 of a sec). Moreover, the overall recognition and segmentation accuracy is shown to be 72.7% when the whole activity sequence is observed. Finally, the online prediction and segmentation accuracy is 68.3% when the prediction is made at every time step."

This differs significantly from the conventional person re-id setting where it is assumed that the full body of a person is detected and aligned. To solve this more challenging and realistic re-id problem without the implicit assumption of manual body-parts alignment, we propose a matching framework consisting of a local patch-level matching model based on a novel sparse representation classification formulation with explicit patch ambiguity modelling, and 2) a global part-based matching model providing complementary spatial layout information. Our framework is evaluated on a new partial person re-id dataset as well as two existing datasets modified to include partial person images. The results show that the proposed method outperforms significantly existing re-id methods as well as other partial visual matching methods."

Our analysis lets us derive a simple, yet effective algorithm to robustify the SIM and make it applicable to realistic scenarios where the data is corrupted by noise. We justify our method by intuitive examples and the matrix perturbation theory. We then show how this approach can be extended to handle missing data, thus yielding an efficient and general sub-space clustering algorithm.  We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over state of-the-art subspace clustering methods on several challenging motion segmentation and face clustering problems, where the data includes corrupted and missing measurements."
http://videolectures.net/iccv2015_kim_multiple_hypothesis/,"This paper revisits the classical multiple hypotheses tracking (MHT) algorithm in a tracking by-detection frame-work. The success of MHT largely depends on the ability to maintain a small list of potential hypotheses, which can be facilitated with the accurate object detectors that are currently available. We demonstrate that a classical MHT implementation from the 90’s can come surprisingly close to the performance of state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets. In order to further utilize the strength of MHT in exploiting higher-order information, we introduce a method for training online appearance models for each track hypothesis. We show that appearance models can be learned efficiently via a regularized least squares framework, requiring only a few extra operations for each hypothesis branch.  We obtain state-of-the-art results on popular tracking-by-detection datasets such as PETS and the recent MOT challenge."

In tracking-by-detection, a major challenge of online MOT is how to robustly associate noisy object detections on a new video frame with previously tracked objects. In this work, we formulate the online MOT problem as decision making in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), where the lifetime of an object is modeled with a MDP. Learning a similarity function for data association is equivalent to learning a policy for the MDP, and the policy learning is approached in a reinforcement learning fashion which benefits from both advantages of offline learning and online-learning for data association. Moreover, our framework can naturally handle the birth/death and appearance/disappearance of targets by treating them as state transitions in the MDP while leveraging existing online single object tracking methods. We conduct experiments on the MOT Benchmark [24] to verify the effectiveness of our method."
