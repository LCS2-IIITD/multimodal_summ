http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_bauckhage_mathematical_models/,"Internet memes are a pervasive phenomenon on the social Web. They typically consist of viral catch phrases, images, or videos that spread through instant messaging, (micro) blogs, forums, and social networking sites. Due to their popularity and proliferation, Internet memes attract interest in areas as diverse as marketing, sociology, or computer science and have been dubbed a new form of communication or artistic expression. In this paper, we examine the merits of such claims and analyze how collective attention into Internet memes evolves over time. We introduce and discuss statistical models of the dynamics of fads and fit them to meme related time series obtained from Google Trends. Given data as to more than 200 memes, we find that our models provide more accurate descriptions of the dynamics of growth and decline of collective attention to individual Internet memes than previous approaches from the literature. In short, our results suggest that Internet memes are nothing but fads."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_tabourier_epidemic_model/,"Citation cascades in blog networks are often considered as traces of information spreading on this social medium. In this work, we question this point of view using both a structural and semantic analysis of five months activity of the most representative blogs of the french-speaking community. Statistical measures reveal that our dataset shares many features with those that can be found in the literature, suggesting the existence of an identical underlying process. However, a closer analysis of the post content indicates that the popular epidemic-like descriptions of cascades are misleading in this context. A basic model, taking only into account the behavior of bloggers and their restricted social network, accounts for several important statistical features of the data. These arguments support the idea that citations primary goal may not be information spreading on the blogosphere."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_dow_facebook_cascades/,"When users post photos on Facebook, they have the option of allowing their friends, followers, or anyone at all to subsequently reshare the photo. A portion of the billions of photos posted to Facebook generates cascades of reshares, enabling many additional users to see, like, comment, and reshare the photos. In this paper we present characteristics of such cascades in aggregate, finding that a small fraction of photos account for a significant proportion of reshare activity and generate cascades of non-trivial size and depth. We also show that the true influence chains in such cascades can be much deeper than what is visible through direct attribution. To illuminate how large cascades can form, we study the diffusion trees of two widely distributed photos: one posted on President Barack Obama’s page following his reelection victory, and another posted by an individual Facebook user hoping to garner enough likes for a cause.We show that the two cascades, despite achieving comparable total sizes, are markedly different in their time evolution, reshare depth distribution, predictability of subcascade sizes, and the demographics of users who propagate them. The findings suggest not only that cascades can achieve considerable size but that they can do so in distinct ways."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_das_self_censorship/,"We report results from an exploratory analysis examining “last-minute” self-censorship, or content that is filtered after being written, on Facebook. We collected data from 3.9 million users over 17 days and associate self-censorship behavior with features describing users, their social graph, and the interactions between them. Our results indicate that 71% of users exhibited some level of last-minute self-censorship in the time period, and provide specific evidence supporting the theory that a user’s “perceived audience” lies at the heart of the issue: posts are censored more frequently than comments, with status updates and posts directed at groups censored most frequently of all sharing use cases investigated. Furthermore, we find that: people with more boundaries to regulate censor more; males censor more posts than females and censor even more posts with mostly male friends than do females, but censor no more comments than females; people who exercise more control over their audience censor more content; and, users with more politically and age diverse friends censor less, in general."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_schoenebeck_online_moms/,"Moms are one of the fastest growing demographics online. While much is known about where they spend their time, little is known about how they spend it. Using a dataset of over 51 million posts and comments from the website YouBeMom.com, this paper explores what kinds of topics moms talk about when they are not constrained by norms and expectations of face-to-face culture. Results show that almost 5% of posts are about dh, or ""dear husband"", but these posts tend to express more negative emotion than other posts. The average post is only 124 characters long and family and daily life are common categories of posting. This suggests that YouBeMom is used as a fast-paced social outlet that may not be available to moms in other parts of their lives. This work concludes with a discussion of anonymity and disinhibition and puts forth a new provocation that moms, too, spend time online ""for the lulz""."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_jang_social_networks/,"Influential people are known to play a key role in diffusing information in a social network. When measuring influence in a social network, most studies have focused on the use of the graph topology representing a network. As a result, popular or famous people tend to be identified as influencers. While they have a potential to influence people with the network connections by propagating information to their friends or followers, it is not clear whether they can indeed serve as an influencer as expected, especially for specific topic areas. In this paper, we introduce the notion of dedicators, which measures the extent to which a user has dedicated to transmit information in selected topic areas to the people in their egocentric networks. To detect topic-based dedicators, we propose a measure that combines both community- level and individual-level factors, which are related to the volume and the engagement level of their conversations and the degree of focus on specific topics. Having analyzed a Twitter conversation data set, we show that dedicators are not co-related with topology-based influencers; users with high in-degree influence tend to have a low dedication level while top dedicators tend to have richer conversations with others, taking advantage of smaller and manageable social networks."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_zarro_repository_building/,"We present findings from a qualitative study of activity on Pinterest.com, in which we investigated professional and personal uses of the site using interview data and observations of online activity. We find that Pinterest serves as an infrastructure for repository building that supports a wide range of activities including: discovery, collecting, collaborating, and publishing. We discuss these concepts using the language of “boundary objects” from the sociology of science. We suggest that scale is a critical dimension of boundary objects for understanding how people make sense of Pinterest and their diverse goals for using it. Professionals often attempt to use Pinterest to create repositories that scale to groups, organizations and societies and interface with multiple social worlds whereas personal repositories often have highly localized meanings. Our approach builds on quantitative descriptions of Pinterest to understand how the site fits into a growing ecology of social network sites."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_hodas_paradox_redux/,"Feld’s friendship paradox states that ""your friends have more friends than you, on average"". This paradox arises because extremely popular people, despite being rare, are overrepresented when averaging over friends. Using a sample of the Twitter firehose, we confirm that the friendship paradox holds for >98% of Twitter users. Because of the directed nature of the follower graph on Twitter, we are further able to confirm more detailed forms of the friendship paradox: everyone you follow or who follows you has more friends and followers than you. This is likely caused by a correlation we demonstrate between Twitter activity, number of friends, and number of followers. In addition, we discover two new paradoxes: the virality paradox that states “your friends receive more viral content than you, on average,” and the activity paradox, which states “your friends are more active than you, on average.” The latter paradox is important in regulating online communication. It may result in users having difficulty maintaining optimal incoming information rates, because following additional users causes the volume of incoming tweets to increase super-linearly. While users may compensate for increased information flow by increasing their own activity, users become information overloaded when they receive more information than they are able or willing to process. We compare the average size of cascades that are sent and received by overloaded and underloaded users. And we show that overloaded users post and receive larger cascades and they are poor detector of small cascades."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_ellison_facebook_friends/,"Past research suggests Facebook use is linked to perceptions of social capital, a concept that taps into the resources people gain from interactions with their social network. In this study, we examine a sample of public Facebook status updates (N=20,000) for instances in which users request a response from their network. These attempts to mobilize resources offer insight into the mechanisms through which Facebook is used for social capital conversion. After identifying mobilization requests (N=856), we categorize them by cost (i.e., effort needed to satisfy the request) and type (e.g., opinion, information, social coordination) in order to describe the prevalence of these requests and the extent to which they require effort on the part of the potential responders. Finally, we examine characteristics of these users and the linguistic characteristics of status updates that contain mobilization requests."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_fourney_citehistory/,"Software engineers often use Q&A forums like Stack Overflow and MSDN to ask and answer technical questions. Through a survey study and web browser log analysis, we find that both askers and answerers of technical forum questions typically conduct extensive online research before composing their posts. The inclusion of links to these research materials is beneficial to the forum participants, though post authors do not always include such citations. Based on these findings, we developed CiteHistory, a browser plugin that simplifies the process of including relevant search queries and URLs as bibliographic supplements to forum posts, and supports information re-finding for post authors. We discuss the results of a two-week deployment of CiteHistory with professional software engineers, which demonstrated that CiteHistory increased reference inclusion in posts, and offered auxiliary benefits as a personal research tracker."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_kairam_social_media/,"Many search engines identify bursts of activity around particular topics and reflect these back to users as Popular Now or Hot Searches. Activity around these topics typically evolves quickly in real-time during the course of a trending event. Users’ informational needs when searching for such topics will vary depending on the stage at which they engage with an event. Through a survey and log study, we observe that interaction with content about trending events varies significantly with prior awareness of the event. Building on this observation, we conduct a larger-scale analysis of query logs and social media data associated with hundreds of trending events. We find that search and social media activity tend to follow similar temporal patterns, but that social media activity leads by a few hours. While user interest in trending event content predictably diverges during peak activity periods, the overlap between content searched and shared increases. We discuss how these findings relate to the design of interfaces to better support sensemaking around trending events by integrating real-time social media content with traditional search results."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_hristova_social_mapping/,"OpenStreetMap has grown rapidly into an exemplary geowiki, where contributors collectively build an open map of the world. Official ‘mapping party’ events are organized on a regular basis to invite users to socialize, map and to engage new-comers locally. Here, we measure the direct and indirect impact of mapping parties on user contributions in both the short and long terms. We question whether this social mapping is a cause for users to become highly committed through a social bond, or is an effect of the mappers’ need to find a common social ground. We show that mapping parties have distinct effects on different types of users, with a more profound direct impact on weaker contributors and a longer term effect on heavy contributors."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_jurgens_social_relationships/,"Social networks are often grounded in spatial locality where individuals form relationships with those they meet nearby. However, the location of individuals in online social networking platforms is often unknown. Prior approaches have tried to infer individuals’ locations from the content they produce online or their online relations, but often are limited by the available location-related data. We propose a new method for social networks that accurately infers locations for nearly all of individuals by spatially propagating location assignments through the social network, using only a small number of initial locations. In five experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness in multiple social networking platforms, using both precise and noisy data to start the inference, and present heuristics for improving performance. In one experiment, we demonstrate the ability to infer the locations of a group of users who generate over 74% of the daily Twitter message volume with an estimated median location error of 10km. Our results open the possibility of gathering large quantities of location-annotated data from social media platforms."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_morstatter_comparing_data/,"Twitter is a social media giant famous for the exchange of short, 140-character messages called “tweets”. In the scientific community, the microblogging site is known for openness in sharing its data. It provides a glance into its millions of users and billions of tweets through a “Streaming API” which provides a sample of all tweets matching some parameters preset by the API user. The API service has been used by many researchers, companies, and governmental institutions that want to extract knowledge in accordance with a diverse array of questions pertaining to social media. The essential drawback of the Twitter API is the lack of documentation concerning what and how much data users get. This leads researchers to question whether the sampled data is a valid representation of the overall activity on Twitter. In this work we embark on answering this question by comparing data collected using Twitter’s sampled API service with data collected using the full, albeit costly, Firehose stream that includes every single published tweet. We compare both datasets using common statistical metrics as well as metrics that allow us to compare topics, networks, and locations of tweets. The results of our work will help researchers and practitioners understand the implications of using the Streaming API."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_garcia_gavilanes_twitter/,"Previous studies have established the link between one’s actions (e.g., engaging with others vs. minding one’s own business) and one’s national culture (e.g., collectivist vs. individualistic), and such actions have been shown to be important as they are collectively affiliated with a country’s economic outcomes (e.g., Gross Domestic Product). Hitherto there has not been any systematic study of whether one’s action on Twitter (e.g., deciding when to post messages) is linked to one’s culture (e.g., country’s Pace of Life). To fix that, we build different network snapshots starting from 55,000 seed users on Twitter, and we do so for 10 weeks across 30 countries (after filtering those with low penetration rates) for a total of 2.34Mprofiles. Based on Hofstede’s theory of cultural dimensions and Levine’s Pace of Life theory, we consider three behavioral patterns on Twitter (i.e., temporal predictability of tweets, engaging with others, and supporting others who are less popular) and associate them with three different dimensions derived from the two theories: Pace of Life, Individualism and Power Distance. We find the following strong correlations: activity predictability negatively correlates with Pace of Life (r = −0.62), tweets with mentions negatively correlates with Individualism (r = −0.55), and power (e.g, Twitter popularity) imbalance in relationships (between, for example, two users mentioning each other) is correlated with Power Distance (r = 0.62). These three cultural dimensions matter because they are associated with a country’s socio-economic aspects - with GDP per capita, income inequality, and education expenditure."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_lin_social_dynamics/,"We examine the growth, survival, and context of 256 novel hashtags during the 2012 U.S. presidential debates. Our analysis reveals the trajectories of hashtag use fall into two distinct classes: ""winners"" that emerge more quickly and are sustained for longer periods of time than other ""also-rans"" hashtags. We propose a ""conversational vibrancy"" framework to capture dynamics of hashtags based on their topicality, interactivity, diversity, and prominence. Statistical analyses of the growth and persistence of hashtags reveal novel relationships between features of this framework and the relative success of hashtags. Specifically, retweets always contribute to faster hashtag adoption, replies extend the life of ""winners"" while having no effect on ""also-rans."" This is the first study on the lifecycle of hashtag adoption and use in response to purely exogenous shocks. We draw on theories of uses and gratification, organizational ecology, and language evolution to discuss these findings and their implications for understanding social influence and collective action in social media more generally."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_tan_topical_structure/,"People’s interests and people’s social relationships are intuitively connected, but understanding their interplay and whether they can help predict each other has remained an open question. We examine the interface of two decisive structures forming the backbone of online social media: the graph structure of social networks - who connects with whom - and the set structure of topical affiliations - who is interested in what. In studying this interface, we identify key relationships whereby each of these structures can be understood in terms of the other. The context for our analysis is Twitter, a complex social network of both follower relationships and communication relationships. On Twitter, “hashtags” are used to label conversation topics, and we examine hashtag usage alongside these social structures. We find that the hashtags that users adopt can predict their social relationships, and also that the social relationships between the initial adopters of a hashtag can predict the future popularity of that hashtag. By studying weighted social relationships, we observe that while strong reciprocated ties are the easiest to predict from hashtag structure, they are also much less useful than weak directed ties for predicting hashtag popularity. Importantly, we show that computationally simple structural determinants can provide remarkable performance in both tasks. While our analyses focus on Twitter, we view our findings as broadly applicable to topical affiliations and social relationships in a host of diverse contexts, including the movies people watch, the brands people like, or the locations people frequent."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_lakkaraju_social_media/,"Creating, placing, and presenting social media content is a difficult problem. In addition to the quality of the content itself, several factors such as the way the content is presented (the title), the community it is posted to, whether it has been seen before, and the time it is posted determine its success. There are also interesting interactions between these factors. For example, the language of the title should be targeted to the community where the content is submitted, yet it should also highlight the distinctive nature of the content. In this paper, we examine how these factors interact to determine the popularity of social media content. We do so by studying resubmissions, i.e., content that has been submitted multiple times, with multiple titles, to multiple different communities. Such data allows us to ‘tease apart’ the extent to which each factor influences the success of that content. The models we develop help us understand how to better target social media content: by using the right title, for the right community, at the right time."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_ruths_political_orientation/,"Numerous papers have reported great success at inferring the political orientation of Twitter users. This paper has some unfortunate news to deliver: while past work has been sound and often methodologically novel, we have discovered that reported accuracies have been systemically overoptimistic due to the way in which validation datasets have been collected, reporting accuracy levels nearly 30% higher than can be expected in populations of general Twitter users. Using careful and novel data collection and annotation techniques, we collected three different sets of Twitter users, each characterizing a different degree of political engagement on Twitter - from politicians (highly politically vocal) to “normal” users (those who rarely discuss politics). Applying standard techniques for inferring political orientation, we show that methods which previously reported greater than 90% inference accuracy, actually achieve barely 65% accuracy on normal users. We also show that classifiers cannot be used to classify users outside the narrow range of political orientation on which they were trained. While a sobering finding, our results quantify and call attention to overlooked problems in the latent attribute inference literature that, no doubt, extend beyond political orientation inference: the way in which datasets are assembled and the transferability of classifiers."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_munson_browser_widget/,"The Internet gives individuals more choice in political news and information sources and more tools to filter out disagreeable information. Citing the preference described by selective exposure theory - people prefer information that supports their beliefs and avoid counter-attitudinal information - observers warn that people may use these tools to access only agreeable information and thus live in ideological echo chambers. We report on a field deployment of a browser extension that showed users feedback about the political lean of their weekly and all time reading behaviors. Compared to a control group, showing feedback led to a modest move toward balanced exposure, corresponding to 1-2 visits per week to ideologically opposing sites or 5-10 additional visits per week to centrist sites."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2013_calais_guerra_polarization/,"Polarization in social media networks is a fact in several scenarios such as political debates and other contexts such as same-sex marriage, abortion and gun control. Understanding and quantifying polarization is a longterm challenge to researchers from several areas, also being a key information for tasks such as opinion analysis. In this paper, we perform a systematic comparison between social networks that arise from both polarized and non-polarized contexts. This comparison shows that the traditional polarization metric – modularity – is not a direct measure of antagonism between groups, since non-polarized networks may be also divided into fairly modular communities. To bridge this conceptual gap, we propose a novel polarization metric based on the analysis of the boundary of a pair of (potentially polarized) communities, which better captures the notions of antagonism and polarization. We then characterize polarized and non-polarized social networks according to the concentration of high-degree nodes in the boundary of communities, and found that polarized networks tend to exhibit low concentration of popular nodes along the boundary. To demonstrate the usefulness of our polarization measures, we analyze opinions expressed on Twitter on the gun control issue in the United States, and conclude that our novel metrics help making sense of opinions expressed on online media."

We aim to identify the type of content and motivations for sharing health-related activity in social media outlets. To this end, we performed a qualitative analysis of Twitter posts, as well as an extensive set of interviews with experienced users who post messages on Twitter about exercise, diet, and weight loss activities. The qualitative analysis exposes varying levels of activity actualization and message sentiment. The interviews help us reason about the users practices and motivations for posting activity related to the pursuit and maintenance of volitional health behaviors. Our findings extend existing theoretical frameworks and can inform the design of technology that uses social media to help initiate and maintain challenging activities like exercise and diet."

Our results highlight key differences between the two groups in terms of perception towards online social media and behaviors within such systems. Non-depressed individuals perceived Twitter as an information consuming and sharing tool, while depressed individuals perceived it as a tool for social awareness and emotional interaction.

Whether in the spread of disease, the diffusion of information, the propagation of behavioral contagions, the effectiveness of viral marketing, or the magnitude of peer effects in a variety of settings, two key questions must be answered before we can understand whether networks matter: 1) how the content that flows through networks affects the patterns of outcomes we see across nodes and 2) whether the statistical relationships we observe can be interpreted causally. Aral will review what we know and where research might go with respect to content and causality in networks. He will provide two examples from each area to structure the discussion: One from an analysis of email networks and the information content that flows through them at a mid-sized executive recruiting firm and the other from a randomized field experiment on a popular social networking website that tests the effectiveness of ""viral product design"" strategies in creating peer influence and social contagion among the 1.4 million friends of 9,687 experimental users."

Yet valuable information is broadcast, and can provide useful insight into time- and safety-critical situations if captured and analyzed properly and rapidly. We describe an approach for automatically identifying messages communicated via Twitter that contribute to situational awareness, and explain why it is beneficial for those seeking information during mass emergencies. We collected Twitter messages from four different crisis events of varying nature and magnitude and built a classifier to automatically detect messages that may contribute to situational awareness, utilizing a combination of hand annotated and automatically-extracted linguistic features. Our system was able to achieve over 80% accuracy on categorizing tweets that contribute to situational awareness. Additionally, we show that a classifier developed for a specific emergency event performs well on similar events. The results are promising, and have the potential to aid the general public in culling and analyzing information communicated during times of mass emergency."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_scellato_spatial/,"The spatial structure of large-scale online social networks has been largely unaccessible due to the lack of available and accurate data about people’s location. However, with the recent surging popularity of location-based social services, data about the geographic position of users have been available for the first time, together with their online social connections. In this work we present a comprehensive study of the spatial properties of the social networks arising among users of three main popular online location-based services. We observe robust universal features across them: while all networks exhibit about 40% of links below 100 km, we further discover strong heterogeneity across users, with different characteristic spatial lengths of interaction across both their social ties and social triads. We provide evidence that mechanisms akin to gravity models may influence how these social connections are created over space.

http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_cheng_footprints/,"Location sharing services (LSS) like Foursquare, Gowalla, and Facebook Places support hundreds of millions of userdriven footprints (i.e., “checkins”). Those global-scale footprints provide a unique opportunity to study the social and temporal characteristics of how people use these services and to model patterns of human mobility, which are significant factors for the design of future mobile+location-based services, traffic forecasting, urban planning, as well as epidemiological models of disease spread. In this paper, we investigate 22 million checkins across 220,000 users and report a quantitative assessment of human mobility patterns by analyzing the spatial, temporal, social, and textual aspects associated with these footprints. We find that: (i) LSS users follow the “L`evy Flight” mobility pattern and adopt periodic behaviors; (ii) While geographic and economic constraints affect mobility patterns, so does individual social status; and (iii) Content and sentiment-based analysis of posts associated with checkins can provide a rich source of context for better understanding how users engage with these services."

For example, recent work has correlated Twitter messages with influenza rates in the United States; but this has largely been the extent of mining Twitter for public health. In this work, we consider a broader range of public health applications for Twitter. We apply the recently introduced Ailment Topic Aspect Model to over one and a half million health related tweets and discover mentions of over a dozen ailments, including allergies, obesity and insomnia. We introduce extensions to incorporate prior knowledge into this model and apply it to several tasks: tracking illnesses over times (syndromic surveillance), measuring behavioral risk factors, localizing illnesses by geographic region, and analyzing symptoms and medication usage. We show quantitative correlations with public health data and qualitative evaluations of model output. Our results suggest that Twitter has broad applicability for public health research."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_steeg_epidemics/,"Theoretical progress in understanding the dynamics of spreading processes on graphs suggests the existence of an epidemic threshold below which no epidemics form and above which epidemics spread to a significant fraction of the graph. We have observed information cascades on the social media site Digg that spread fast enough for one initial spreader to infect hundreds of people, yet end up affecting only 0.1% of the entire network. We find that two effects, previously studied in isolation, combine cooperatively to drastically limit the final size of cascades on Digg. First, because of the highly clustered structure of the Digg network, most people who are aware of a story have been exposed to it via multiple friends. This structure lowers the epidemic threshold while moderately slowing the overall growth of cascades. In addition, we find that the mechanism for social contagion on Digg points to a fundamental difference between information spread and other contagion processes: despite multiple opportunities for infection within a social group, people are less likely to become spreaders of information with repeated exposure. The consequences of this mechanism become more pronounced for more clustered graphs. Ultimately, this effect severely curtails the size of social epidemics on Digg."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_sharara_viral/,"Viral marketing mechanisms use the existing social network between customers to spread information about products and encourage product adoption. Existing viral marketing models focus on the dynamics of the diffusion process, however they typically: (a) only consider a single product campaign and (b) fail to model the evolution of the social network, as the trust between individuals changes over time, during the course of multiple campaigns. In this work, we propose an adaptive viral marketing model which captures: (1) multiple different product campaigns, (2) the diversity in customer preferences among different product categories, and (3) changing confidence in peers’ recommendations over time. By applying our model to a real-world network extracted from the Digg social news website, we provide insights into the effects of network dynamics on the different products’ adoption. Our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms earlier non-adaptive diffusion models in predicting future product adoptions. We also show how this model can be used to explore new viral marketing strategies that are more successful than classic strategies which ignore the dynamic nature of social networks."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_sun_influence/,"In online discussion forums, users are more motivated to take part in discussions when observing other users’ participation — the effect of social influence among forum users. In this paper, we study how to utilize social influence for increasing user participation in online forums. To do so, we propose the use of sidebars, which display forum threads to users, as a mechanism to maximize user influence and boost participation. We formally define the participation maximization problem with the sidebar mechanism, based on the social influence network. We show that it is a special instance of the social welfare maximization problem with submodular utility functions and it is NP-hard. However, generic approximation algorithms for social welfare maximization is too slow to be feasible for real-world forums. Thus we design a heuristic algorithm, named Thread Allocation Based on Influence (TABI), to tackle the problem. Through extensive experiments using a dataset from a real-world online forum, we demonstrate that TABI consistently outperforms all other algorithms, including a personalized recommendation algorithm, in increasing forum participation. The results of this work could facilitate other related studies such as designs for recommendation systems. The problem of participation maximization based on influence also opens a new direction in the study of social influence. Moreover, the proposed techniques can be applied to other social media, e.g., to maximize overall attention for advertisement in Facebook."

We examine two networks of political communication on Twitter, comprised of more than 250,000 tweets from the six weeks leading up to the 2010 U.S. congressional midterm elections. Using a combination of network clustering algorithms and manually-annotated data we demonstrate that the network of political retweets exhibits a highly segregated partisan structure, with extremely limited connectivity between left- and right-leaning users. Surprisingly this is not the case for the user-to-user mention network, which is dominated by a single politically heterogeneous cluster of users in which ideologically-opposed individuals interact at a much higher rate compared to the network of retweets. To explain the distinct topologies of the retweet and mention networks we conjecture that politically motivated individuals provoke interaction by injecting partisan content into information streams whose primary audience consists of ideologically-opposed users.We conclude with statistical evidence in support of this hypothesis."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_livne_election/,"In this work, we study the use of Twitter by House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates during the midterm (2010) elections in the U.S. Our data includes almost 700 candidates and over 690k documents that they produced and cited in the 3.5 years leading to the elections. We utilize graph and text mining techniques to analyze differences between Democrats, Republicans and Tea Party candidates, and suggest a novel use of language modeling for estimating content cohesiveness. Our findings show significant differences in the usage patterns of social media, and suggest conservative candidates used this medium more effectively, conveying a coherent message and maintaining a dense graph of connections. Despite the lack of party leadership, we find Tea Party members display both structural and language-based cohesiveness. Finally, we investigate the relation between network structure, content and election results by creating a proof-of-concept model that predicts candidate victory with an accuracy of 88.0%."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_munson_prevalence/,"Though political theorists have emphasized the importance of political discussion in non-political spaces, past study of online political discussion has focused on primarily political websites. Using a random sample from Blogger.com, we find that 25% of all political posts are from blogs that post about politics less than 20% of the time, because the vast majority of blogs post about politics some of the time but infrequently. Far from being taboo topics in those nonpolitical blogs, political posts got slightly more comments than non-political posts in those same blogs, and the comments overwhelmingly engage the political topics of the post, mostly agreeing but frequently disagreeing as well. We argue that non-political spaces devoted primarily to personal diaries, hobbies, and other topics represent a substantial place of online political discussion and should be a site for further study."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_an_conventions/,"We present a preliminary but groundbreaking study of the media landscape of Twitter. We use public data on whom follows who to uncover common behaviour in media consumption, the relationship between various classes of media, and the diversity of media content which social links may bring. Our analysis shows that there is a non-negligible amount of indirect media exposure, either through friends who follow particular media sources, or via retweeted messages. We show that the indirect media exposure expands the political diversity of news to which users are exposed to a surprising extent, increasing the range by between 60-98%. These results are valuable because they have not been readily available to traditional media, and they can help predict how we will read news, and how publishers will interact with us in the future."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_mesquita_blogosphere/,"Information extraction systems have been recently proposed for organizing and exploring content in large online text corpora as information networks. In such networks, the nodes are named entities (e.g., people, organizations) while the edges correspond to statements indicating relations among such entities. To date, such systems extract rather primitive networks, capturing only those relations which are expressed by direct statements. In many applications, it is useful to also extract more subtle relations which are often expressed as meta statements in the text. These can, for instance provide the context for a statement (e.g., “Google acquired YouTube on October 2006”), or repercussion about a statement (e.g., “The US condemned Russia’s invasion of Georgia”). In this work, we report on a system for extracting relations expressed in both direct statements as well as in meta statements. We propose a method based on Conditional Random Fields that explores syntactic features to extract both kinds of statements seamlessly. We follow the Open Information Extraction paradigm, where a classifier is trained to recognize any type of relation instead of specific ones. Finally, our results show substantial improvements over a state-of-the-art information extraction system, both in terms of accuracy and, especially, recall."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_hurlock_chaff/,"Within the millions of digital communications posted in online social networks, there is undoubtedly some valuable and useful information. Although a large portion of social media content is considered to be babble, research shows that people share useful links, provide recommendations to friends, answer questions, and solve problems. In this paper, we report on a qualitative investigation into the different factors that make tweets ‘useful’ and ‘not useful’ for a set of common search tasks. The investigation found 16 features that help make a tweet useful, noting that useful tweets often showed 2 or 3 of these features. ‘Not useful’ tweets, however, typically had only one of 17 clear and striking features. Further, we saw that these features can be weighted as according to different types of search tasks. Our results contribute a novel framework for extracting useful information from real-time streams of social-media content that will be used in the design of a future retrieval system."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_lee_detection/,"Twitter, as a form of social media, is fast emerging in recent years. Users are using Twitter to report real-life events. This paper focuses on detecting those events by analyzing the text stream in Twitter. Although event detection has long been a research topic, the characteristics of Twitter make it a non- trivial task. Tweets reporting such events are usually overwhelmed by high flood of meaningless ""babbles"". Moreover, event detection algorithm needs to be scalable given the sheer amount of tweets. This paper attempts to tackle these challenges with EDCoW (Event Detection with Clustering of Wavelet-based Signals). EDCoW builds signals for individual words by applying wavelet analysis on the frequency-based raw signals of the words. It then filters away the trivial words by looking at their corresponding signal auto- correlations. The remaining words are then clustered to form events with a modularity-based graph partitioning technique. Experimental studies show promising result of EDCoW. We also present the design of a proof-of-concept system, which was used to analyze netizens' online discussion about Singapore General Election 2011."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_counts_microblog/,"Bias can be defined as selective favoritism exhibited by human beings when posed with a task of decision making across multiple options. Online communities present plenty of decision making opportunities to their users. Users exhibit biases in their attachments, voting and ratings and other tasks of decision making. We study bias amongst microblog users due to the value of an author’s name. We describe the relationship between name value bias and number of followers, and cluster authors and readers based on patterns of bias they receive and exhibit, respectively. For authors we show that content from known names (e.g., @CNN) is rated artificially high, while content from unknown names is rated artificially low. For readers, our results indicate that there are two types: slightly biased, heavily biased. A subsequent analysis of Twitter author names revealed attributes of names that underlie this bias, including effects for gender, type of name (individual versus organization), and degree of topical relevance. We discuss how our work can be instructive to content distributors and search engines in leveraging and presenting microblog content."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_kramer_dimensions/,"We describe the dimensions along which Facebook users tend to express themselves via status updates using the semiautomated text analysis approach, the Meaning Extraction Method (MEM). First, we examined dimensions of selfexpression in all status updates from a sample of four million Facebook users from four English-speaking countries (the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia) in order to examine how these countries vary in their selfexpressions. All four countries showed a basic threecomponent structure, indicating that the medium is a stronger influence than country characteristics or demographics on how people use Facebook status updates. In each country, people vary in terms of the extent to which they use Informal Speech, share Positive Events, and discuss School in their Facebook status updates. Together, these factors tell us how users differ in their self-expression, and thus illustrate meaningful use cases for the product: Talking about what’s going on tends to be positive, and people vary in terms of the extent to which their status updates are short, slangy emotional expressions and topics regarding school. The specific words that define these factors showed subtle differences across countries: The use of profanity indicates fewer school words (but only in Australia), whereas the UK shows greater use of slang terms (rather than profanity) when speaking informally. The MEM also identified English-language dialects as a meaningful dimension along which the countries varied. In sum, beyond simply indicating topicality of posts, this study provides insight into how status updates are used for selfexpression. We discuss several theoretical frameworks that could produce these results, and more broadly discuss the generation of theoretical frameworks from wholly empirical data (such as naturalistic Internet speech) using the MEM."

Studies of personal networks have focused on their size (the number of contacts) and their composition (in terms of categories such as kin and co-workers). Here we propose a new measure for the analysis of personal networks, based on the way in which an individual divides his or her attention across contacts. This allows us to contrast people who focus a large fraction of their interactions on a small set of close friends with people who disperse their attention more widely. Using data from Facebook, we find that this balance of attention is a relatively stable property of an individual over time, and that it displays interesting variation across both different groups of people and different modes of interaction. In particular, activities based on communication involve a much higher focus of attention than activities based simply on observation, and these two types of modalities also exhibit different forms of variation in interaction patterns both within and across groups. Finally, we contrast the amount of attention paid by individuals to their most frequent contacts with the rate of change in the identities of these contacts, providing a measure of churn for this set."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_hasler_poverty/,"This paper presents an ongoing investigation into how people use the Internet in an attempt to escape situations of information poverty. We consider posts from a variety of newsgroups which indicate that individuals feel they have nowhere else to go to find information or support for concerns crucial to their everyday lives. A qualitative content analysis is performed to examine three main issues: what information needs people posting to these groups have, who they hide these needs from in the ‘real world’, and why they feel they can only express their needs online. Preliminary findings show that information on health and relationships is most commonly sought. Needs are most often hidden from parents and family, and the main reasons for seeking information online are a lack of understanding and the fact that people simply don’t know where else to go. Our work confirms that newsgroups provide a means of expression for those who feel they have no local support available to them."

We begin by describing /b/ and performing a content analysis that suggests the community is dominated by playful exchanges of images and links. Our first study uses a large dataset of more than five million posts to quantify ephemerality in /b/. We find that most threads spend just five seconds on the first page and less than five minutes on the site before expiring. Our second study is an analysis of identity signals on 4chan, finding that over 90% of posts are made by fully anonymous users, with other identity signals adopted and discarded at will. We describe alternative mechanisms that /b/ participants use to establish status and frame their interactions."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_keegan_clandestine/,Gold farming and real money trade refer to a set of illicit practices in massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) whereby players accumulate virtual resources to sell for “real world” money. Prior work has examined trade relationships formed by gold farmers but not the trust relationships which exist between members of these organizations. We adopt a hypergraph approach to model the multi-modal relationships of gold farmers granting other players permission to use and modify objects they own. We argue these permissions reflect underlying trust relationships which can be analyzed using network analysis methods. We compare farmers’ trust networks to the trust networks of both unidentified farmers and typical players. Our results demonstrate that gold farmers’ networks are different from trust networks of normal players whereby farmers trust highly-central non-farmer players but not each other. These findings have implications for augmenting detection methods and re-evaluating theories of clandestine behavior.
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2011_gosling_ambiance/,"Recently, several online social networking sites (OSNs; e.g., FourSquare) have emerged that allow people to record and broadcast their presence at physical locations. We examined the viability of using images of frequent patrons listed on an establishment’s FourSquare page to infer the ambiance of the establishment. In Study 1, 10 judges independently rated 25 bars and 24 cafes in Austin, Texas. Ratings were based on the profile pictures of 25 randomly selected persons who frequented each establishment. Ratings tapped ambient physical and psychological qualities (e.g., loud, creepy), typical-patron personalities (e.g., extraverted), and likely patron activities (e.g., dancing). Results indicated considerable inter-judge consensus across the attributes rated (mean ICCs averaged .32, .69. and .33 for the ambiance, patronpersonality, and patron-activity variables respectively). In Study 2, a second team of 10 observers visited each target establishment during business hours and rated each location on the same set of variables. These ratings also showed strong inter-judge consensus (mean ICCs averaged .69, .79. and .62 for the ambiance, patron-personality, and patronactivity variables respectively). Correlations between the ratings obtained in Studies 1 and 2 showed surprisingly strong convergence suggesting that the profile photos conveyed valid information about the target establishments."

While a minority, such as Wikipedia, MySpace, Facebook and the Apache Server project are highly successful, many others fail. To be successful, online communities must overcome challenges common in almost all groups, organizations and voluntary associations – solving problems of start-up, recruitment, socialization, commitment, contribution, coordination and regulation of behavior. The social sciences can tell us a lot about how to create thriving online communities. Social science theories can inform choices about how to get a community started, integrate newcomers, encourage commitment, regulate behavior when there are conflicts, motivate contributions, and coordinate those contributions to maximize benefits for the community.  This talk focuses on ways to build members’ commitment to online communities, based on theories of social identity and interpersonal bonds. It provides an overview of the relevant theory, describes results of a 6-month field experiment in which an existing site was redesigned based on principles derived from social identity and interpersonal-bond theories, and describes the results of an agent-based model that examines how different approaches to moderating the content in a group influence social identity and interpersonal bonds."

http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_suri_sim/,"The spread of influence among individuals in a social network can be naturally modeled in a probabilistic framework, but it is challenging to reason about differences between various models as well as to relate these models to actual social network data. Here we consider two of the most fundamental definitions of influence, one based on a small set of ""snapshot'' observations of a social network and the other based on detailed temporal dynamics. The former is particularly useful because large-scale social network data sets are often available only in snapshots or crawls. The latter however provides a more detailed process model of how influence spreads. We study the relationship between these two ways of measuring influence, in particular establishing how to infer the more detailed temporal measure from the more readily observable snapshot measure.

http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_tufekci_waf/,"There is an ongoing debate, not just among academics but in popular culture, about whether social media can expand people’s social networks, and whether online friends can be “real” friends. The debate refuses to die. This paper addresses this question subjectively, from the point of view of the user, and examines the predictors of acquiring new friends through social media use. This is a multi-method study with quantitative (n=617) and qualitative sections. Some previous studies have found a “rich-get-richer” effect where people who are socially active offline appear to benefit most from online interactions. This paper is based on the idea that whether online friends can be real friends may be subject to a self-fulfilling prophecy: those who do not believe that online friendships can be real friendships are not likely to make such connections. I compare the “Rich Get Richer” and “Seek and Ye Shall Find” models by examining relationships between the amount of offline socializing, amount of online social activity and the belief in online friendships. I also qualitatively examine reasons cited by respondents as to why online sociality is or is not a plausible route to meaningful friendship. The results show strong support for one of the earliest theories of computer-mediated-communication: hyperpersonal interaction. It appears that a sizable portion of the young generation finds online interaction positive because it is perceived to concentrate on the conversation itself, rather than on appearances, and is seen as freer of social judgments. African-Americans are significantly more likely to meet new friends online. There also appear to be underlying personality traits, apart from traditional demographic variables, that divide the population in terms of their attitude towards online sociality."

First, we adapt the Kohonen self organizing maps in order to cluster the users of online platforms depending on their audience and authority characteristics. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of the manner nodes are organized in the social network. Finally, we study the relationship between the network local structure around each node and the corresponding user’s popularity. We apply this method to the MySpace music social network. We observe that the most popular artists are centers of star shaped social structures and that it exists a fraction of artists who are involved in community and social activity dynamics independently of their popularity. This method based on a learning algorithm and on network analysis appears to be a robust and intuitive technique for a rich description of the online behavior."

Social ties particularly play a significant role in paid transactions for sellers with a moderately sized customer base. We further find that sellers enjoying repeat business are likely to be selling to niche markets, because their customers tend to be contained in a smaller number of groups.

The three measures were designed to capture associations at different levels of mental processing, from very automatic (electrical brain activity) to conscious and reasoned (questionnaire). At more conscious levels of cognitive processing, Facebook was seen as interesting, addictive, and highly personal.

Thus, we present an analysis of interpersonal relationships in English reciprocal contexts.

http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_dechoudhury_hdd/,"Platforms such as Twitter have provided researchers with ample opportunities to analytically study social phenomena. There are however, significant computational challenges due to the enormous rate of production of new information: researchers are therefore, often forced to analyze a judiciously selected “sample” of the data. Like other social media phenomena, information diffusion is a social process–it is affected by user context, and topic, in addition to the graph topology. This paper studies the impact of different attribute and topology based sampling strategies on the discovery of an important social media phenomena–information diffusion. We examine several widely-adopted sampling methods that select nodes based on attribute (random, location, and activity) and topology (forest fire) as well as study the impact of attribute based seed selection on topology based sampling. Then we develop a series of metrics for evaluating the quality of the sample, based on user activity (e.g. volume, number of seeds), topological (e.g. reach, spread) and temporal characteristics (e.g. rate). We additionally correlate the diffusion volume metric with two external variables–search and news trends. Our experiments reveal that for small sample sizes (30%), a sample that incorporates both topology and user context (e.g. location, activity) can improve on naive methods by a significant margin of 15-20%."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_russo_tot/,"Along with the growth in artifact sharing in online communities such as Flickr, YouTube, and Facebook comes the demand for adding descriptive meta-information, or tags. Tags help individuals to organize and communicate the content and context of their work for themselves and for others. This longitudinal study draws on research in social psychology, network theory and online communities to explain tagging over time. Our findings suggest that tagging increases as a contributor receives attention from others in the community. Further, we find that the more a user's network neighbors are connected to each other directly, the less the focal user will tend to tag his photos. However, density interacts with attention such that those who are surrounded by a dense ego network respond more to attention than others whose ego networks are sparsely interconnected. Unexpectedly, we find no direct correlation between tagging and the individual motivations of enjoyment and commitment. While commitment is not directly associated with tagging, there is an interaction effect such that the effect of commitment on tagging is positive for users with low-density ego networks and negative when a user is surrounded by a high-density network. Directions for future research as well as implications for theory and practice are discussed."

Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others — a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user."

This study uses the context of the German federal election to investigate whether Twitter is used as a forum for political deliberation and whether online messages on Twitter validly mirror offline political sentiment. Using LIWC text analysis software, we conducted a content-analysis of over 100,000 messages containing a reference to either a political party or a politician. Our results show that Twitter is indeed used extensively for political deliberation. We find that the mere number of messages mentioning a party reflects the election result. Moreover, joint mentions of two parties are in line with real world political ties and coalitions. An analysis of the tweets’ political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to the parties' and politicians’ political positions indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape. We discuss the use of microblogging message content as a valid indicator of political sentiment and derive suggestions for further research."

We analyze several surveys on consumer conﬁdence and political opinion over the 2008 to 2009 period, and ﬁnd they correlate to sentiment word frequencies in contemporaneous Twitter messages. While our results vary across datasets, in several cases the correlations are as high as 80%, and capture important large-scale trends. The results highlight the potential of text streams as a substitute and supplement for traditional polling. consumer conﬁdence and political opinion, and can also pre- dict future movements in the polls. We ﬁnd that temporal smoothing is a critically important issue to support a successful model."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_lerman_ice/,"Social networks have emerged as a critical factor in information dissemination, search, marketing, expertise and influence discovery, and potentially an important tool for mobilizing people. Social media has made social networks ubiquitous, and also given researchers access to massive quantities of data for empirical analysis. These data sets offer a rich source of evidence for studying dynamics of individual and group behavior, the structure of networks and global patterns of the flow of information on them. However, in most previous studies, the structure of the underlying networks was not directly visible but had to be inferred from the flow of information from one individual to another. As a result, we do not yet understand dynamics of information spread on networks or how the structure of the network affects it. We address this gap by analyzing data from two popular social news sites. Specifically, we extract social networks of active users on Digg and Twitter, and track how interest in news stories spreads among them. We show that social networks play a crucial role in the spread of information on these sites, and that network structure affects dynamics of information flow."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_yardi_tts/,"This paper examines tweets about two geographically local events - a shooting and a building collapse - that took place in Wichita, Kansas and Atlanta, Georgia, respectively. Most Internet research has focused on examining ways the Internet can connect people across long distances, yet there are benefits to being connected to others who are nearby. People in close geographic proximity can provide real-time information and eyewitness updates for one another about events of local interest. We first show a relationship between structural properties in the Twitter network and geographic properties in the physical world. We then describe the role of mainstream news in disseminating local information. Last, we present a poll of 164 users’ information seeking practices. We conclude with practical and theoretical implications for sharing information in local communities."

However, much less is known about how technology in general, and social technologies in particular can motivate people to participate in green activities. In this paper we describe the goals, design and evaluation of StepGreen.org, a site intended to promote energy-saving behaviors. We present the results of a field study, during which participants chose to engage in different actions and reported when they had completed them. Our results suggest that motivating factors like public commitment and competition are effective, and better leveraging these factors will likely lead to even greater appeal and effectiveness. Our contribution is to create an understanding of the impact of different decisions on the success of StepGreen.org that can benefit the designers of other multifaceted, online systems for behavior change."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_leskovec_gsm/,"Social media sites are often guided by a core group of committed users engaged in various forms of {governance. A crucial aspect of this type of governance is deliberation, in which such a group reaches decisions on issues of importance to the site. Despite its crucial — though subtle — role in how a number of prominent social media sites function, there has been relatively little investigation of the deliberative aspects of social media governance. Here we explore this issue, investigating a particular deliberative process that is extensive, public, and recorded: the promotion of Wikipedia admins, which is determined by elections that engage committed members of the Wikipedia community. We find that the group decision-making at the heart of this process exhibits several fundamental forms of relative assessment. First we observe that the chance that a voter will support a candidate is strongly dependent on the relationship between characteristics of the voter and the candidate. Second we investigate how both individual voter decisions and overall election outcomes can be based on models that take into account the sequential, public nature of the voting."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_monroy_hernandez_mako_hill_rrs/,"In this paper we describe the ways participants of the Scratch online community, primarily young people, engage in remixing of each others' shared animations, games, and interactive projects. In particular, we try to answer the following questions: How do users respond to remixing in a social media environment where remixing is explicitly permitted? What qualities of originators and their projects correspond to a higher likelihood of plagiarism accusations? Is there a connection between plagiarism complaints and similarities between a remix and the work it is based on? Our findings indicate that users have a very wide range of reactions to remixing and that as many users react positively as accuse remixers of plagiarism. We test several hypotheses that might explain the high number of plagiarism accusations related to original project complexity, cumulative remixing, originators' integration into remixing practice, and remixee-remixer project similarity, and find support for the first and last explanations."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_tsur_gcn/,"Sarcasm is a sophisticated form of speech act widely used in online communities. Automatic recognition of sarcasm is, however, a novel task. Sarcasm recognition could contribute to the performance of review summarization and ranking systems. This paper presents SASI, a novel Semi-supervised Algorithm for Sarcasm Identification that recognizes sarcastic sentences in product reviews. SASI has two stages: semi-supervised pattern acquisition, and sarcasm classification. We experimented on a data set of about 66000 Amazon reviews for various books and products. Using a gold standard in which each sentence was tagged by 3 annotators, we obtained precision of 77% and recall of 83.1% for identifying sarcastic sentences. We found some strong features that characterize sarcastic utterances. However, a combination of more subtle pattern-based features proved more promising in identifying the various facets of sarcasm. We also speculate on the motivation for using sarcasm in online communities and social networks."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm2010_mcglohon_arr/,"Given a set of reviews of products or merchants from a wide range of authors and several reviews websites, how can we measure the true quality of the product or merchant?  How do we remove the bias of individual authors or sources?  How do we compare reviews obtained from different websites, where ratings may be on different scales (1-5 stars, A/B/C, etc.)?  How do we filter out unreliable reviews to use only the ones with ""star quality""?  Taking into account these considerations, we analyze data sets from a variety of different reviews sites (the first paper, to our knowledge, to do this). These data sets include 8 million product reviews and 1.5 million merchant reviews. We explore statistic - and heuristic - based models for estimating the true quality of a product or merchant, and compare the performance of these estimators on the task of ranking pairs of objects.  We also apply the same models to the task of using Netflix ratings data to rank pairs of movies, and discover that the performance of the different models is surprisingly similar on this data set."

We discuss a set of approaches for tracking pieces of text as they travel and mutate in these networks, applying these ideas to a set of related problems. First, we show how this type of analysis can capture temporal patterns in the news over a daily time-scale --- in particular, the succession of story lines that evolve, compete for attention, and collectively produces an effect that commentators refer to as the 'news cycle.' Second, we show how this approach can be combined with an analysis of network structure to trace the diffusion of specific pieces of information as they spread between people at a global scale.

http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_lee_fisaom/,"""What do other people think?"" has always been an important consideration to most of us when making decisions. Long before the World Wide Web, we asked our friends who they were planning to vote for and consulted Consumer Reports to decide which dishwasher to buy. But the Internet has (among other things) made it possible to learn about the opinions and experiences of those in the vast pool of people that are neither our personal acquaintances nor well-known professional critics --- that is, people we have never heard of. Enter sentiment analysis, a flourishing research area devoted to the computational treatment of subjective and opinion-oriented language. Sample phenomena to contend with range from sarcasm in blog postings to the interpretation of political speeches. This talk will cover some of the motivations, challenges, and approaches in this broad and exciting field."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_gosling_niederhofer_psm/,"Every action taken on a social media platform is performed by a psychological being trying to satisfy some kind of psychological need-that is, individuals use social media to meet their emotional, social, attitudinal, cognitive, behavioral, and identity needs. Media systems that adapt to these needs (which have evolved over many millions of years) will be more successful than those that do not.  This tutorial will present a range of theories and recent empirical research in social, personality, and cognitive psychology to inform research and design on social media platforms. For example, self-verification theory predicts that much social interaction is motivated not by people's need to be seen in a favorable light by others but by their needs to be seen by others as people see themselves; this prediction is supported by research examining perceptions of others based on their websites and Facebook profiles.  Person-environment theories can be used to understand the processes of selection, evocation, and manipulation by which people use social media platforms to improve the fit between themselves and their social, physical, and virtual environments. The presentation will be geared towards drawing design implications for social media systems and for providing psychological frameworks to guide data collection about the individuals and groups that use social media."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_sun_gmctfnf/,"Whether they are modeling bookmarking behavior in Flickr or cascades of failure in large networks, models of diffusion often start with the assumption that a few nodes start long chain reactions, resulting in large-scale cascades. While rea-sonable under some conditions, this assumption may not hold for social media networks, where user engagement is high and information may enter a system from multiple dis-connected sources. Using a dataset of 262,985 Facebook Pages and their as-sociated fans, this paper provides an empirical investigation of diffusion through a large social media network. Although Facebook diffusion chains are often extremely long (chains of up to 82 levels have been observed), they are not usually the result of a single chain-reaction event. Rather, these dif-fusion chains are typically started by a substantial number of users. Large clusters emerge when hundreds or even thousands of short diffusion chains merge together. This paper presents an analysis of these diffusion chains using zero-inflated negative binomial regressions. We show that after controlling for distribution effects, there is no meaningful evidence that a start node’s maximum diffusion chain length can be predicted with the user’s demographics or Facebook usage characteristics (including the user’s number of Facebook friends). This may provide insight into future research on public opinion formation."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_wei_soeac/,"This talk presents the first comprehensive exploration of the largest Chinese online knowledge sharing community- Baidu Knows. With analyzing 5.2 millions questions and 2.7 million users participated during 4.5 months on the site in 2008, we investigate how users adjust initial attempts and behave differently according to the level of participation; in particular, there is a positive dynamic for answerers to input more, be more focused, win more, and thus be rewarded more. As the result, a core user group forms to actively participate in both asking and answering across categories, thus maintaining a self-sufficient community. In addition, a prominent ""sense of community"" would enhance the social bonds within the community, especially for the contributors who can offer expertise but can rarely learn from others. The study suggests Baibu Knows as a successful design instance for further studies."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_mcglohon_csifu/,"Studying Usenet provides unique insight into online communities, since there is often a pre-defined space for community interaction. Here, we examine a large set of posts in nearly 200 politically-oriented newsgroups over a period of 4 years, using a unique and novel approach to the analysis. Our study is multi-scale: not only do we examine the newsgroups individually and compare measurements of different groups, but we also examine the relationships between the groups. Since users often post to multiple groups, shared participating authors or cross posts may be a way to assess how closely related, content-wise, two groups may be. However, this also causes some confusion of relevance. To combat this effect, we develop an “ownership” measure of an article to the set of cross-posted groups, based on the posting activity of the author. We show that this ownership measure can greatly improve assessment of information diffusion within and between groups, and suggest using it to improve analysis in other problems."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_gill_watba/,"Personal weblogs (blogs), provide individuals with the opportunity to write freely and express themselves online in the presence of others. In such situations, what do bloggers write about, and what are their motivations for blogging? Using a large blog corpus annotated with the LIWC text analysis program, we examine the content of blogs to provide insight into the role of personality in motivation for blogging. As predicted, we find that highly Neurotic authors use blogs to serve a cathartic or auto-therapeutic function, and reflect mainly upon themselves and negative emotions. Highly Extraverted blog authors, as expected, use blogs to document their lives at a high level, and uniquely interact directly with the reader. Additionally Extraverts use blogs to vent both positive and negative emotions. Bloggers who are high scorers on the Openness trait are more concerned with leisure activities, although they are more evaluative than intellectual, whereas high Conscientiousness bloggers tend to report daily life – and work – around them. As in other contexts, expressing positive rather than negative emotions is associated with high Agreeableness, but that trait is associated with self reference to a greater degree in blogs than elsewhere. In general, findings are consistent with other contexts indicating that bloggers tend to adapt to the possibilities of the medium, rather than try to present themselves differently"
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_agarwal_siaifs/,"We present a novel problem of searching for ‘familiar strangers’ in a social network. Familiar strangers are individuals who are not directly connected but exhibit some similarity. The power-law nature of social networks determines that majority of individuals are directly connected with a small number of fellow individuals, and similar individuals can be largely unknown to each other. Moreover, the individuals of a social network have only a local view of the network, which makes the problem of aggregating these familiar strangers a challenge. In this work, we formulate the problem, show why it is significant to address the challenge, and present an approach that innovatively employs the social identities of the individuals with competitive approaches. The blogger and citation network are used to showcase technical details and empirical results with related issues and future work."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_lieberman_yawye/,"Whether knowingly or otherwise, Wikipedia contributors reveal their interests and expertise through their contribution patterns. An analysis of Wikipedia edit histories shows that it is often possible to associate contributors with relatively small geographic regions, usually corresponding to where they were born or where they presently live. For many contributors, the geographic coordinates of pages they have edited are tightly clustered. Results suggest that a wealth of information about contributors can be gleaned from edit histories. This illustrates the efficacy of data mining on large, publicly-available datasets and raises potential privacy concerns."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_koutrika_crccss/,"Social sites are extremely popular among users but user interactions in most sites revolve around relatively simple tasks, such as uploading resources, tagging and poking friends. We believe that social sites can go beyond simple interactions among individuals and offer valuable services to well-defined, closed, communities (e.g., an academic, corporate or scientific community). In this paper, we present an example of a closed-community social system, CourseRank, an educational and social site where Stanford students can explore course offerings and plan their academic program. We perform an analysis of 12 months worth of CourseRank data including user contributed information, such as ratings and comments, as well as information extracted from the user logs, and we analyze several aspects of user interactions and user-contributed content in the site, such as activity levels, user behavior and user content quality. Our findings provide useful insights with respect to the potential of closed community social sites."

Given a collection of reviews, our REVRANK algorithm identifies a lexicon of dominant terms that constitutes the core of a virtual optimal review. This lexicon defines a feature vector representation. Reviews are then converted to this representation and ranked according to their distance from a ‘virtual core’ review vector. The algorithm is fully unsupervised and thus avoids costly and error-prone manual training annotations. Our experiments show that REVRANK clearly outperforms a baseline imitating the Amazon user vote review ranking system."

We illustrate this modeling approach in the context of user-created content on the news rating site Digg."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_goetz_mbd/,"How do blogs produce posts? What local, underlying mechanisms lead to the bursty temporal behaviors observed in blog networks? Earlier work analyzed network patterns of blogs and found that blog behavior is bursty and often follows power laws in both topological and temporal characteristics. However, no intuitive and realistic model has yet been introduced, that can lead to such patterns. This is exactly the focus of this work. We propose a generative model that uses simple and intuitive principles for each individual blog, and yet it is able to produce the temporal characteristics of the blogosphere together with global topological network patterns, like power-laws for degree distributions, for inter-posting times, and several more. Our model ZC uses a novel ‘zero-crossing’ approach based on a random walk, combined with other powerful ideas like exploration and exploitation. This makes it the first model to simultaneously model the topology and temporal dynamics of the blogosphere. We validate our model with experiments on a large collection of 45,000 blogs and 2.2 million posts."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_munson_safidno/,"Aggregators rely on votes, and links to select and present subsets of the large quantity of news and opinion items gen- erated each day. Opinion and topic diversity in the output sets can provide individual and societal benefits, but simply selecting the most popular items may not yield as much di- versity as is present in the overall pool of votes and links. In this paper, we define three diversity metrics that ad- dress different dimensions of diversity: inclusion, non- alienation, and proportional representation. We then present the Sidelines algorithm – which temporarily suppresses a voter’s preferences after a preferred item has been selected – as one approach to increase the diversity of result sets. In comparison to collections of the most popular items, from user votes on Digg.com and links from a panel of political blogs, the Sidelines algorithm increased inclusion while de- creasing alienation. For the blog links, a set with known po- litical preferences, we also found that Sidelines improved proportional representation. In an online experiment using blog link data as votes, readers were more likely to find something challenging to their views in the Sidelines result sets. These findings can help build news and opinion aggre- gators that present users with a broader range of topics and opinions."
http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_cha_ffr/,"Blogs are a popular way to share personal journals, discuss matters of public opinion, pursue collaborative conversations, and aggregate content on similar topics. Blogs also disseminate new content and novel ideas to communities of interest. But how does content spread across these communities, what kinds of content spreads, and at what rate? This paper presents an analysis of the network structure and the spreading patterns of media content in the blogosphere. Based on 8.7 million posts in 1.1 million blogs across 15 major blog hosting sites, we show that the network structure of blogs is different from that of other online social networks: most links are unidirectional and the network is sparse. We also find that user generated content, often in the form of videos or photos, is the most common type of content shared in blogs. Focusing on the distribution of 10,000 popularly linked YouTube videos in blogs, we demonstrate how propagation patterns depend on content category. For example, the latest political news video immediately catches the attention of bloggers and fades away after a week, while a music video propagates slowly over a long period of time."

http://videolectures.net/icwsm09_sood_vasserman_esse/,"Future machines will connect with users on an emotional level in addition to performing complex computations (Norman 2004). In this article, we present a system that adds an emotional dimension to an activity that Internet users engage in frequently, search. ESSE, which stands for Emotional State Search Engine, is a web search engine that goes beyond facilitating a user’s exploration of the web by topic, as search engines such as Google or Yahoo! afford. Rather, it enables the user to browse their topically relevant search results by mood, providing the user with a unique perspective on the topic at hand. Consider a user wishing to read opinions about the new president of the United States. Typing “President Obama” into a Google search box will return (among other results), a few recent news stories about Obama, the Whitehouse’s website, as well as a wikipedia article about him. Typing “President Obama” into a Google Blog Search box will bring the user a bit closer to their goal in that all of the results are indeed blogs (typically opinions) about Obama. However, where blog search engines fall short is in providing users with a way to navigate and digest the vastness of the blogosphere, the incredible number of results for the query “President Obama” (approximately 17,335,307 as of 2/24/09) (Google Blog Search 2009). ESSE provides another dimension by which users can take in the vastness of the web or the blogosphere.

In particular we track variations in the intensity of discussion on a given event over time. We demonstrate that our model is capable of tracking both events and sub-events at a finer granularity.
