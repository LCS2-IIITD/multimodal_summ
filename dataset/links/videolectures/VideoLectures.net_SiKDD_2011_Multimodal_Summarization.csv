http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_hsuan_privacy/,"This talk will examine the current debate about how KDD research should be legally regulated, and what it means if privacy rights fail to be protected . . . and what it could mean if they are."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_canhasi_multidocument/,"Multi-document summarization is a process of automatic creation of a compressed version of the given collection of documents. Recently, the graph-based models and ranking algorithms have been extensively researched by the extractive document summarization community. While most work to date focuses on sentence-level relations in this paper we present graph model that emphasizes not only sentence level relations but also the influence of under sentence level relations (e.g. a part of sentence similarity). By using the proven cognitive psychology model (the Event-Indexing model) and semantic role parsing for generating the frame graph, we establish the bases for distinguishing the sentence level relations. Based on this model, we developed an iterative frame and sentence ranking algorithm, based on the existing well known PageRank algorithm. Experiments are conducted on the DUC 2004 data sets and the ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) evaluation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_mladenic_assertions/,"We present an early version of a method for open-domain semantic assertion extraction from natural language texts. To combat the shortage of training data for the task, a two-stage pipeline is employed: we first perform semantic role labeling, then map the resulting frames onto predicate-form, ontology-aligned statements. We chose FrameNet and Cyc as the frame database and the ontology, respectively."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_karlovcec_community/,"Using advanced analysis techniques new useful insight into data can be achieved. This paper addresses a problem of gaining insights in the data on scientific collaboration on a National level, where data can be seen as a graph with researchers and research content. Two existing visualization techniques were applied on data about scientific community in Slovenia: collaboration diagram and competence map. Collaboration diagram gives a clear overview of collaborations for a selected researcher, while competence map shows semantically grouped research content the researcher has worked on."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_skrbec_archives/,"This paper proposes a pipeline for searching and browsing through newspaper archives. It uses a combination of algorithms for extracting information from text and tools for visualizing different text structures capable of handling large amount of articles that are normally collected in archives. The proposed pipeline is implemented as a web application, illustrative results show appropriateness of the proposed pipeline for searching and browsing news archives."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_zdravkova_ghostwriter/,"Ghostwriting became students’ most popular way to avoid writing of boring essays, or the best way to easily earn by writing on behalf of another student. This paper presents several markers indicating a presence of potential ghostwriters. Proposed methodology suggests various inspection techniques, which do not prove anything in isolation. Whenever they are jointly implemented, they successfully cluster the essays, suggesting plausible absence, potential and almost certain presence of one or few ghostwriters. After the initial clustering, all the papers go through subtle linguistic check. In our sample, later approach discovered some unexpected phrases which confirmed the presence of the same ghostwriters not only in the current, but also in the previous generations."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_tomasev_hubness/,"Hubness is a phenomenon present in many highdimensional data sets. It is related to the skewness in the distribution of k-occurrences, i.e. occurrences of data points in k-neighbor sets of other data points. Several hubnessaware methods that focus on exploiting this phenomenon have recently been proposed. In this paper, we examine the potential impact of weighting the k-occurrences, by taking into account the distance between the respective data points, on hubness-aware nearest-neighbor methods, more specifically hw-kNN, h-FNN and HIKNN. We show that such distance-based weighting can be both advantageous and detrimental and that it influences different methods in different ways."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_gjorgjioski_classification/,"Multi-label classification has received significant attention in the research community over the past few years: this has resulted in the development of a variety of multi-label classification methods. These methods either transform the multi-label dataset to several simpler datasets or adapt the learning algorithm so it can handle the multiple labels. In this paper, we consider the latter approach. Namely, we use predictive clustering trees to perform multi-label classification. Furthermore, we perform an experimental comparison of four distance measures used to select the splits in the nodes of the trees. The experimental evaluation was conducted on 6 benchmark datasets using 6 different evaluation measures. The results show that, averaged overall, the Euclidean distance and the Hamming loss yield the best predictive performance."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_brank_hierarchical/,"One of the ways of approaching a multiclass classification problem is to transform it into several two-class (binary) classification problems. An ensemble of binary classifiers is trained for these tasks and their predictions are combined using a voting method into predictions for the original multiclass problem. Each of the new binary problems uses some of the original classes as positive training data, some classes as negative training data and the remaining classes (if any) are not used at all. The relationship between classes (of the original problem) and binary classifiers can be concisely represented by a matrix called the coding matrix. In this paper we explore some of the statistical properties of the space of coding matrix based classifiers in the context of a small hierarchical multiclass learning problem."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_chudan_olap/,"The paper presents a comparison of possibilities and proposal for complementary use of OLAP and the rich variant of association rule mining based on the GUHA method. The rationale is to determine the point when it is useful for the analyst to proceed from OLAP to descriptive data mining, as well as the point of return from data mining results to OLAP in order to see them in a broader view."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_kosir_multilingual/,"An online advertising network connects web content providers and advertisers enabling the providers to monetize their content and the advertisers to reach online consumers. In this paper we study the workings of a successful state-of-the-art online advertising network with branch offices all over the world. The framework is designed to support different targeting strategies and advertising in multiple languages. We describe the implementation of contextual and behavioral targeting, and also discuss different methods to evaluating these strategies. Statistics show that by employing contextual targeting instead of random targeting we can achieve significantly higher CTR values."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_tomasev_oceanographic/,"In this paper we examine how the high dimensionality of oceanographic sensor data impacts the potential use of nearest-neighbor machine learning methods. We focus on one particular consequence of the curse of dimensionality – hubness. We examine the hubness of oceanographic data and show how it can be used to visualize and detect both prototypical sensors/locations, as well as ambiguous and potentially erroneous ones. We proceed to define an easy classification problem on the data, showing that the recently developed hubness-aware classification methods may help to overcome some of the hubness-related issues in sensor data."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_leban_duplicates/,"Bug tracking systems (BTS) are systems that allow users of some software to report to developers bugs they encountered while using it. Common problem of BTS are duplicated reports of the same bug. Since identifying bug duplicates is a time consuming task we show in this paper an approach to automatically identifying duplicates using text-mining methods. We demonstrate the usability of our method on KDE Bugzilla BTS which contains 249,083 bug reports of which 47,093 are duplicates."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_pracner_wikimage/,"This paper presents work towards the creation of free and redistributable datasets of correlated images and text. Collections of free images and related text were extracted from Wikipedia with our new tool WIKImage. An additional tool – WIKImage browser – was introduced to visualize the resulting dataset, and was expanded into a manual labeling tool. The paper presents a starting dataset of 1007 images labeled with any combination of 14 tags.  The images were processed into a number of scale invariant (SIFT) and color histogram features, and the captions were transformed into a bag-of-words (BOW) representation. Experiments were then performed with the aim of classifying data with respect to each of the labels on dataset variants with just the image information, just the textual data, and both, in order to estimate the difficulty of the dataset in the context of different feature spaces. Results indicate improvements in precision, recall and the F-measure when using the combined representation with support vector machines as well as the k-nearest neighbor classifier with the cosine similarity measure."
http://videolectures.net/sikdd2011_farajikhah_madanchi_spectral/,"In this study, the principal component analysis (PCA) technique and its nonlinear version (NLPCA) are employed for the compression and reconstruction of spectral data. The reflectance spectra of 1269 matt Munsell color chips are used as original dataset in 400 to 700 nm with 10 nm intervals. The hidden patterns of spectral data are determined by employing the classical PCA as well as its nonlinear version. Different numbers of feature vectors are used in both methods and the results compared by using the root mean square error (RMS), the goodness fit coefficients (GFC) as well as the color difference values under D65 illuminant and 1964 standard observer. Results show the priority of NLPCA over the PCA in low-dimensional spaces i.e. up to 4 basic functions, while different results are observed in higher-dimensional spaces."
