Given a small part of labeled nodes (about 10%) in aWeb linkage graph, the challenge is to predict other nodes’ class to be spam or normal.We extract features from link-based data, and then combine them with text-based features. After feature scaling, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) are modeled in the extremely high dimensional space with about 5 million features. Stratified 3-fold cross validation for SVM and out-of-bag estimation for RF are used to tune the modeling parameters and estimate the generalization capability. On the small corpus for Web host classification, the best F-Measure value is 75.46% and the best AUC value is 95.11%. On the large corpus for Web page classification, the best F-Measure value is 90.20% and the best AUC value is 98.92%."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_inan_pqs/,"In this talk, a data stream architecture is presented for electrical power quality (PQ) which is called PQStream. PQStream is developed to process and manage time-evolving data coming from the country-wide mobile measurements of electrical PQ parameters of the Turkish Electricity Transmission System. It is a full-fledged system with a data measurement module which carries out processing of continuous PQ data, a stream database which stores the output of the measurement module, and finally a Graphical User Interface for retrospective analysis of the PQ data stored in the stream database. The presented model is deployed and is available to PQ experts, academicians and researchers of the area. As further studies, data mining methods such as classification and clustering algorithms will be applied in order to deduce useful PQ information from this database of PQ data."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_tang_msd/,"Clustering is to classify unlabeled data into groups. It has been wellresearched for decades in many disciplines. Clustering in massive amount of astronomical data generated by multi-sensor networks has become an emerging new challenge; assumptions in many existing clustering algorithms are often violated in these domains. For example, K means implicitly assumes that underlying distribution of data is Gaussian. Such an assumption is not necessarily observed in astronomical data. Another problem is the determination of K, which is hard to decide when prior knowledge is lacking. While there has been work done on discovering the proper value for K given only the data, most existing works, such as X-means, G-means and PG-means, assume that the model is a mixture of Gaussians in one way or another. In this paper, we present a similarity-driven clustering approach for tackling large scale clustering problem. A similarity threshold T is used to constrain the search space of possible clustering models such that only those satisfying the threshold are accepted. This forces the search to: 1) explicitly avoid getting stuck in local minima, and hence the quality of models learned has a meaningful lower bound, and 2) discover a proper value for K as new clusters have to be formed if merging them into existing ones will violate the constraint given by the threshold. Experimental results on the UCI KDD archive and realistic simulated data generated for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) suggest that such an approach is promising."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_pereiro_sfa/,"The Online Divisive-Agglomerative Clustering (ODAC) is an incremental approach for clustering streaming time series using a hierarchical procedure over time. It constructs a tree-like hierarchy of clusters of streams, using a top-down strategy based on the correlation between streams. The system also possesses an agglomerative phase to enhance a dynamic behavior capable of structural change detection. However, the split decision used in the algorithm focus on the crisp boundary between two groups, which implies a high risk since it has to decide based on only a small subset of the entire data. In this work we propose a semi-fuzzy approach to the assignment of variables to newly created clusters, for a better trade-off between validity and performance. Experimental work supports the benefits of our approach."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_mohamed_radod/,"Online data mining in wireless sensor networks is concerned with the problem of extracting knowledge from a large continuous amount of data streams with an in-network processing mode. Unlike other types of networks, the limited computational resources require the mining algorithms to be highly efficient and compact.We propose a distributed resource-aware online data mining framework for wireless sensor networks which can be used to enable existing mining techniques to be applied to sensor network environments. We have applied the framework to develop and implement a distributed resource adaptive online clustering algorithm on the novel Sun MicrosystemTM Small Programmable Object Technology Sun SPOT platform. We have evaluated the performance of the algorithm on the actual sensor nodes. Experimental results show that the clustering algorithm can improve significantly in resource utilization while maintaining acceptable accuracy level."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_hruschka_qibc/,"This talk describes and empirically evaluates a Quasi-Incremental Bayesian Classifier (QBC) designed to be used when a classification task must be performed in dynamic systems such as sensor networks, which are continuously receiving new piece of information to be stored in huge databases. Therefore, the knowledge that needs to be extracted from these databases is continuously evolving and the learning process may need to go on almost indefinitely. The induction proposed by QBC is performed in two steps; in the first one a traditional Bayesian Network (BN) induction algorithm is performed using an initial amount of data. As far as new data is available, only the numerical parameters of the classifier are updated. The conducted experiments showed that QBC tends to maintain the average correct classification rates obtained with non-incremental classifiers while decreasing the time needed to induce the classifier."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_saveliev_eaaio/,"Real-time data mining of high-speed and non-stationary data streams has a large potential in such fields as efficient operation of machinery and vehicles, wireless sensor networks, urban traffic control, stock data analysis etc.. These domains are characterized by a great volume of noisy, uncertain data, and restricted amount of resources (mainly computational time). Anytime algorithmsoffer a tradeoff between solution quality and computation time, which has proveduseful in applying artificial intelligence techniques to time-critical problems. Inthis paper we are presenting a new, enhanced version of an anytime algorithm forconstructing a classification model called Information Network (IN). The algorithmimprovement is aimed at reducing its computational cost while preservingthe same level of model quality. The quality of the induced model is evaluatedby its classification accuracy using the standard 10-fold cross validation. Theimprovement in the algorithm anytime performance is demonstrated on severalbenchmark data streams."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_an_esqg/,"As various users and applications require the distribution and sharing of information in XML documents, the need for an efficient secure access of XML data in a ubiquitous data stream environment has become very important. In this paper, we propose an efficient secure XML query processing method to solve the two problems by using role-based prime number labeling and XML fragmentation. A medical records XML document has the characteristic of an infinite addition in width rather than in depth because of the increment of patients. But a role-based prime number labeling method can fully manage the size of documents that increases to infinity and can minimize the maintenance cost caused by dynamic changes. Experimental evaluation clearly demonstrates that our approach is efficient and secure."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_ting_lor/,"In this talk, we introduce a modified Kalman filter that performs robust, real-time outlier detection, without the need for manual parameter tuning by the user. Systems that rely on high quality sensory data (for instance, robotic systems) can be sensitive to data containing outliers. The standard Kalman filter is not robust to outliers, and other variations of the Kalman filter have been proposed to overcome this issue. However, these methods may require manual parameter tuning, use of heuristics or complicated parameter estimation procedures. Our Kalman filter uses a weighted least squares-like approach by introducing weights for each data sample. A data sample with a smaller weight has a weaker contribution when estimating the current time step’s state. Using an incremental variational Expectation-Maximization framework, we learn the weights and system dynamics. We evaluate our Kalman filter algorithm on data from a robotic dog."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_mohamed_mqgr/,"Data streams are produced continuously at a high speed. Most data stream mining techniques address this challenge by using adaptation and approximation techniques. Adapting to available resources has been addressed recently. Although these techniques ensure the continuity of the data mining process under resource limitation, the quality of the output is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose a generic model that guarantees the quality of the output while maintaining efficient resource consumption. The model works on estimating the quality of the output given the available resources. Only a subset of these resources will be used that guarantees the minimum quality loss. The model is generalized for any data stream mining technique."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_mohamed_acac/,"In resource-constrained devices, adaptation of data stream processing to variations of data rates, availability of resources and environment changes is crucial for consistency and continuity of running applications. Context-aware adaptation, as a new dimension of research in data stream mining, enhances and optimizes distributed data stream processing tasks. Context-awareness is one of the key aspects of ubiquitous computing as applicationsC¸ successful operations rely on detecting changes and adjusting accordingly. This paper presents a general architecture for context-aware adaptive mining of data streams that aims to dynamically and autonomously adjust data stream mining parameters according to changes in context and resource availability in distributed and heterogeneous computing environments."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_gama_lnc/,"OLINDDA (OnLIne Novelty and Drift Detection Algorithm) addresses the problem of novelty detection in an online continuous learning scenario as an extension to a single-class classification problem. This paper presents its current version, that evolved toward the discovery of new concepts initially as emerging clusters and further as cohesive sets of clusters. New strategies for validation and merging of clusters as well as for dynamically adapting the number of clusters are discussed and experimentally evaluated."
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_siklosi_ssl/,We compare a wide range of semi-supervised learning techniques both for Web spam filtering and for telephone user churn classification. Semisupervised learning has the assumption that the label of a node in a graph is similar to those of its neighbors. In this paper we measure this phenomenon both for Web spam and telco churn. We conclude that spam is often linked to spam while honest pages are linked to honest ones; similarly churn occurs in bursts in groups of a social network.
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_galeano_afm/,Given an n vertex weighted tree with (structural) diameter SG and a set of ` vertices we give a method to compute the corresponding `×` Gram matrix of the pseudoinverse of the graph Laplacian in O(n + `2SG) time. We discuss the application of this method to predicting the labeling of a graph. Preliminary experimental results on a digit classification task are given.
http://videolectures.net/ecml07_landwehr_rtt/,"The ability to recognize human activities from sensory information is essential for developing the next generation of smart devices. Many human activity recognition tasks are from a machine learning perspective quite similar to tagging tasks in natural language processing. Motivated by this similarity, we develop a relational transformation-based tagging system based on inductive logic programming principles, which is able to cope with expressive relational representations as well as a background theory. The approach is experimentally evaluated on two activity recognition tasks and compared to Hidden Markov Models, one of the most popular and successful approaches for tagging."
