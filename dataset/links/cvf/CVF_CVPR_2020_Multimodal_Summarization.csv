https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGszWVyDF9c,"Intrinsic image decomposition, which is an essential task in computer vision, aims to infer the reflectance and shading of the scene. It is challenging since it needs to separate one image into two components. To tackle this, conventional methods introduce various priors to constrain the solution, yet with limited performance. Meanwhile, the problem is typically solved by supervised learning methods, which is actually not an ideal solution since obtaining ground truth reflectance and shading for massive general natural scenes is challenging and even impossible. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised intrinsic image decomposition framework, which relies on neither labeled training data nor hand-crafted priors. Instead, it directly learns the latent feature of reflectance and shading from unsupervised and uncorrelated data. To enable this, we explore the independence between reflectance and shading, the domain invariant content constraint and the physical constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real image datasets demonstrate consistently superior performance of the proposed method."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsbwQTDWeXA,"Weight and activation binarization is an effective approach to deep neural network compression and can accelerate the inference by leveraging bitwise operations. Although many binarization methods have improved the accuracy of the model by minimizing the quantization error in forward propagation, there remains a noticeable performance gap between the binarized model and the full-precision one. Our empirical study indicates that the quantization brings information loss in both forward and backward propagation, which is the bottleneck of training accurate binary neural networks. To address these issues, we propose an Information Retention Network (IR-Net) to retain the information that consists in the forward activations and backward gradients. IR-Net mainly relies on two technical contributions: (1) Libra Parameter Binarization (Libra-PB): simultaneously minimizing both quantization error and information loss of parameters by balanced and standardized weights in forward propagation; (2) Error Decay Estimator (EDE): minimizing the information loss of gradients by gradually approximating the sign function in backward propagation, jointly considering the updating ability and accurate gradients. We are the first to investigate both forward and backward processes of binary networks from the unified information perspective, which provides new insight into the mechanism of network binarization. Comprehensive experiments with various network structures on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets manifest that the proposed IR-Net can consistently outperform state-of-the-art quantization methods."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NrIHdicyAo,"In this paper, we explore the space-time video super-resolution task, which aims to generate a high-resolution (HR) slow-motion video from a low frame rate (LFR), low-resolution (LR) video. A simple solution is to split it into two sub-tasks: video frame interpolation (VFI) and video super-resolution (VSR). However, temporal interpolation and spatial super-resolution are intra-related in this task. Two-stage methods cannot fully take advantage of the natural property. In addition, state-of-the-art VFI or VSR networks require a large frame-synthesis or reconstruction module for predicting high-quality video frames, which makes the two-stage methods have large model sizes and thus be time-consuming. To overcome the problems, we propose a one-stage space-time video super-resolution framework, which directly synthesizes an HR slow-motion video from an LFR, LR video. Rather than synthesizing missing LR video frames as VFI networks do, we firstly temporally interpolate LR frame features in missing LR video frames capturing local temporal contexts by the proposed feature temporal interpolation network. Then, we propose a deformable ConvLSTM to align and aggregate temporal information simultaneously for better leveraging global temporal contexts. Finally, a deep reconstruction network is adopted to predict HR slow-motion video frames. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves better quantitative and qualitative performance but also is more than three times faster than recent two-stage state-of-the-art methods, e.g., DAIN+EDVR and DAIN+RBPN."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q38l8pKqNsc,"Person Re-IDentification (P-RID), as an instance-level recognition problem, still remains challenging in computer vision community. Many P-RID works aim to learn faithful and discriminative features/metrics from offline training data and directly use them for the unseen online testing data. However, their performance is largely limited due to the severe data shifting issue between training and testing data. Therefore, we propose an online joint multi-metric adaptation model to adapt the offline learned P-RID models for the online data by learning a series of metrics for all the sharing-subsets. Each sharing-subset is obtained from the proposed novel frequent sharing-subset mining module and contains a group of testing samples which share strong visual similarity relationships to each other. Unlike existing online P-RID methods, our model simultaneously takes both the sample-specific discriminant and the set-based visual similarity among testing samples into consideration so that the adapted multiple metrics can refine the discriminant of all the given testing samples jointly via a multi-kernel late fusion framework. Our proposed model is generally suitable to any offline learned P-RID baselines for online boosting, the performance improvement by our model is not only verified by extensive experiments on several widely-used P-RID benchmarks (CUHK03, Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17) and state-of-the-art P-RID baselines but also guaranteed by the provided in-depth theoretical analyses."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx3_nXcOqV0,"When we humans look at a video of human-object interaction, we can not only infer what is happening but we can even extract actionable information and imitate those interactions. On the other hand, current recognition or geometric approaches lack the physicality of action representation. In this paper, we take a step towards more physical understanding of actions. We address the problem of inferring contact points and the physical forces from videos of humans interacting with objects. One of the main challenges in tackling this problem is obtaining ground-truth labels for forces. We sidestep this problem by instead using a physics simulator for supervision. Specifically, we use a simulator to predict effects, and enforce that estimated forces must lead to same effect as depicted in the video. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that (a) we can predict meaningful forces from videos whose effects lead to accurate imitation of the motions observed, (b) by jointly optimizing for contact point and force prediction, we can improve the performance on both tasks in comparison to independent training, and (c) we can learn a representation from this model that generalizes to novel objects using few shot examples."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se0cf-uk_L8,"Deciding the amount of neurons during the design of a deep neural network to maximize performance is not intuitive. In this work, we attempt to search for the neuron (filter) configuration of a fixed network architecture that maximizes accuracy. Using iterative pruning methods as a proxy, we parametrize the change of the neuron (filter) number of each layer with respect to the change in parameters, allowing us to efficiently scale an architecture across arbitrary sizes. We also introduce architecture descent which iteratively refines the parametrized function used for model scaling. The combination of both proposed methods is coined as NeuralScale. To prove the efficiency of NeuralScale in terms of parameters, we show empirical simulations on VGG11, MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 using CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet as benchmark datasets. Our results show an increase in accuracy of 3.04%, 8.56% and 3.41% for VGG11, MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet respectively under a parameter-constrained setting (output neurons (filters) of default configuration with scaling factor of 0.25)."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWnEkDE-oe8,"Real-noise denoising is a challenging task because the statistics of real-noise do not follow the normal distribution, and they are also spatially and temporally changing. In order to cope with various and complex real-noise, we propose a well-generalized denoising architecture and a transfer learning scheme. Specifically, we adopt an adaptive instance normalization to build a denoiser, which can regularize the feature map and prevent the network from overfitting to the training set. We also introduce a transfer learning scheme that transfers knowledge learned from synthetic-noise data to the real-noise denoiser. From the proposed transfer learning, the synthetic-noise denoiser can learn general features from various synthetic-noise data, and the real-noise denoiser can learn the real-noise characteristics from real data. From the experiments, we find that the proposed denoising method has great generalization ability, such that our network trained with synthetic-noise achieves the best performance for Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND) among the methods from published papers. We can also see that the proposed transfer learning scheme robustly works for real-noise images through the learning with a very small number of labeled data."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JZdnwtsE6I,"Colorectal cancer screening modalities, such as optical colonoscopy (OC) and virtual colonoscopy (VC), are critical for diagnosing and ultimately removing polyps (precursors for colon cancer). The non-invasive VC is normally used to inspect a 3D reconstructed colon (from computed tomography scans) for polyps and if found, the OC procedure is performed to physically traverse the colon via endoscope and remove these polyps. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework, Extended and Directional CycleGAN, for lossy unpaired image-to-image translation between OC and VC to augment OC video sequences with scale-consistent depth information from VC and VC with patient-specific textures, color and specular highlights from OC (e.g. for realistic polyp synthesis). Both OC and VC contain structural information, but it is obscured in OC by additional patient-specific texture and specular highlights, hence making the translation from OC to VC lossy. The existing CycleGAN approaches do not handle lossy transformations. To address this shortcoming, we introduce an extended cycle consistency loss, which compares the geometric structures from OC in the VC domain. This loss removes the need for the CycleGAN to embed OC information in the VC domain. To handle a stronger removal of the textures and lighting, a Directional Discriminator is introduced to differentiate the direction of translation (by creating paired information for the discriminator), as opposed to the standard CycleGAN which is direction-agnostic. Combining the extended cycle consistency loss and the Directional Discriminator, we show state-of-the-art results on scale-consistent depth inference for phantom, textured VC and for real polyp and normal colon video sequences. We also present results for realistic pendunculated and flat polyp synthesis from bumps introduced in 3D VC models."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UocwJjwjeII,"Panoptic segmentation aims to perform instance segmentation for foreground instances and semantic segmentation for background stuff simultaneously. The typical top-down pipeline concentrates on two key issues: 1) how to effectively model the intrinsic interaction between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation, and 2) how to properly handle occlusion for panoptic segmentation. Intuitively, the complementarity between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation can be leveraged to improve the performance. Besides, we notice that using detection/mask scores is insufficient for resolving the occlusion problem. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel deep panoptic segmentation scheme based on a bidirectional learning pipeline. Moreover, we introduce a plug-and-play occlusion handling algorithm to deal with the occlusion between different object instances. The experimental results on COCO panoptic benchmark validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Codes will be released soon at https://github.com/Mooonside/BANet."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fonR1Q5tvDU,"3D convolution neural networks (CNN) have been proved very successful in parsing organs or tumours in 3D medical images, but it remains sophisticated and time-consuming to choose or design proper 3D networks given different task contexts. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is proposed to solve this problem by searching for the best network architecture automatically. However, the inconsistency between search stage and deployment stage often exists in NAS algorithms due to memory constraints and large search space, which could become more serious when applying NAS to some memory and time-consuming tasks, such as 3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine neural architecture search (C2FNAS) to automatically search a 3D segmentation network from scratch without inconsistency on network size or input size. Specifically, we divide the search procedure into two stages: 1) the coarse stage, where we search the macro-level topology of the network, i.e. how each convolution module is connected to other modules; 2) the fine stage, where we search at micro-level for operations in each cell based on previous searched macro-level topology. The coarse-to-fine manner divides the search procedure into two consecutive stages and meanwhile resolves the inconsistency. We evaluate our method on 10 public datasets from Medical Segmentation Decalthon (MSD) challenge, and achieve state-of-the-art performance with the network searched using one dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of our searched models."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIj2VTzmgmM,"Temporal convolution has been widely used for video classification. However, it is performed on spatio-temporal contexts in a limited view, which often weakens its capacity of learning video representation. To alleviate this problem, we propose a concise and novel SmallBig network, with the cooperation of small and big views. For the current time step, the small view branch is used to learn the core semantics, while the big view branch is used to capture the contextual semantics. Unlike traditional temporal convolution, the big view branch can provide the small view branch with the most activated video features from a broader 3D receptive field. Via aggregating such big-view contexts, the small view branch can learn more robust and discriminative spatio-temporal representations for video classification. Furthermore, we propose to share convolution in the small and big view branch, which improves model compactness as well as alleviates overfitting. As a result, our SmallBigNet achieves a comparable model size like 2D CNNs, while boosting accuracy like 3D CNNs. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale video benchmarks, e.g., Kinetics400, Something-Something V1 and V2. Our SmallBig network outperforms a number of recent state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. The codes and models will be available on https://github.com/xhl-video/SmallBigNet."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDd2hxpgznk,"Existing fully-supervised person re-identification (ReID) methods usually suffer from poor generalization capability caused by domain gaps. The key to solving this problem lies in filtering out identity-irrelevant interference and learning domain-invariant person representations. In this paper, we aim to design a generalizable person ReID framework which trains a model on source domains yet is able to generalize/perform well on target domains. To achieve this goal, we propose a simple yet effective Style Normalization and Restitution (SNR) module. Specifically, we filter out style variations (e.g., illumination, color contrast) by Instance Normalization (IN). However, such a process inevitably removes discriminative information. We propose to distill identity-relevant feature from the removed information and restitute it to the network to ensure high discrimination. For better disentanglement, we enforce a dual causal loss constraint in SNR to encourage the separation of identity-relevant features and identity-irrelevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong generalization capability of our framework. Our models empowered by the SNR modules significantly outperform the state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches on multiple widely-used person ReID benchmarks, and also show superiority on unsupervised domain adaptation."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5AB06sCJ90,"Trained on large datasets, deep learning (DL) can accurately classify videos into hundreds of diverse classes. However, video data is expensive to annotate. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) proposes one solution to this problem. ZSL trains a model once, and generalizes to new tasks whose classes are not present in the training dataset. We propose the first end-to-end algorithm for ZSL in video classification. Our training procedure builds on insights from recent video classification literature and uses a trainable 3D CNN to learn the visual features. This is in contrast to previous video ZSL methods, which use pretrained feature extractors. We also extend the current benchmarking paradigm: Previous techniques aim to make the test task unknown at training time but fall short of this goal. We encourage domain shift across training and test data and disallow tailoring a ZSL model to a specific test dataset. We outperform the state-of-the-art by a wide margin. Our code, evaluation procedure and model weights are available online github.com/bbrattoli/ZeroShotVideoClassification."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxR-vtRIHNQ,"We propose a single-stage Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection method that has outperformed all existing methods on HICO-DET dataset at 37 fps on a single Titan XP GPU. It is the first real-time HOI detection method. Conventional HOI detection methods are composed of two stages, i.e., human-object proposals generation, and proposals classification. Their effectiveness and efficiency are limited by the sequential and separate architecture. In this paper, we propose a Parallel Point Detection and Matching (PPDM) HOI detection framework. In PPDM, an HOI is defined as a point triplet < human point, interaction point, object point>. Human and object points are the center of the detection boxes, and the interaction point is the midpoint of the human and object points. PPDM contains two parallel branches, namely point detection branch and point matching branch. The point detection branch predicts three points. Simultaneously, the point matching branch predicts two displacements from the interaction point to its corresponding human and object points. The human point and the object point originated from the same interaction point are considered as matched pairs. In our novel parallel architecture, the interaction points implicitly provide context and regularization for human and object detection. The isolated detection boxes unlikely to form meaningful HOI triplets are suppressed, which increases the precision of HOI detection. Moreover, the matching between human and object detection boxes is only applied around limited numbers of filtered candidate interaction points, which saves much computational cost. Additionally, we build a new application-oriented database named HOI-A, which serves as a good supplement to the existing datasets."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCK-N4T_tMU,"The primary aim of single-image super-resolution is to construct a high-resolution (HR) image from a corresponding low-resolution (LR) input. In previous approaches, which have generally been supervised, the training objective typically measures a pixel-wise average distance between the super-resolved (SR) and HR images. Optimizing such metrics often leads to blurring, especially in high variance (detailed) regions. We propose an alternative formulation of the super-resolution problem based on creating realistic SR images that downscale correctly. We present a novel super-resolution algorithm addressing this problem, PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration), which generates high-resolution, realistic images at resolutions previously unseen in the literature. It accomplishes this in an entirely self-supervised fashion and is not confined to a specific degradation operator used during training, unlike previous methods (which require training on databases of LR-HR image pairs for supervised learning). Instead of starting with the LR image and slowly adding detail, PULSE traverses the high-resolution natural image manifold, searching for images that downscale to the original LR image. This is formalized through the ""downscaling loss,"" which guides exploration through the latent space of a generative model. By leveraging properties of high-dimensional Gaussians, we restrict the search space to guarantee that our outputs are realistic. PULSE thereby generates super-resolved images that both are realistic and downscale correctly. We show extensive experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in the domain of face super-resolution (also known as face hallucination). Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality at higher resolutions and scale factors than previously possible."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S2M3TJYSks,"In this paper, we target to address the problem of compression and acceleration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we propose a novel structural pruning method to obtain a compact CNN with strong discriminative power. To find such networks, we propose an efficient discrete optimization method to directly optimize channel-wise differentiable discrete gate under resource constraint while freezing all the other model parameters. Although directly optimizing discrete variables is a complex non-smooth, non-convex and NP-hard problem, our optimization method can circumvent these difficulties by using the straight-through estimator. Thus, our method is able to ensure that the sub-network discovered within the training process reflects the true sub-network. We further extend the discrete gate to its stochastic version in order to thoroughly explore the potential sub-networks. Unlike many previous methods requiring per-layer hyper-parameters, we only require one hyper-parameter to control FLOPs budget. Moreover, our method is globally discrimination-aware due to the discrete setting. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7STQSQb_So,"We propose SDFDiff, a novel approach for image-based shape optimization using differentiable rendering of 3D shapes represented by signed distance functions (SDFs). Compared to other representations, SDFs have the advantage that they can represent shapes with arbitrary topology, and that they guarantee watertight surfaces. We apply our approach to the problem of multi-view 3D reconstruction, where we achieve high reconstruction quality and can capture complex topology of 3D objects. In addition, we employ a multi-resolution strategy to obtain a robust optimization algorithm. We further demonstrate that our SDF-based differentiable renderer can be integrated with deep learning models, which opens up options for learning approaches on 3D objects without 3D supervision. In particular, we apply our method to single-view 3D reconstruction and achieve state-of-the-art results."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzvaNiXrNAw,"In last few years, supervised deep learning has emerged as one powerful tool for image denoising, which trains a denoising network over an external dataset of noisy/clean image pairs. However, the requirement on a high-quality training dataset limits the broad applicability of the denoising networks. Recently, there have been a few works that allow training a denoising network on the set of external noisy images only. Taking one step further, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning method which only uses the input noisy image itself for training. In the proposed method, the network is trained with dropout on the pairs of Bernoulli-sampled instances of the input image, and the result is estimated by averaging the predictions generated from multiple instances of the trained model with dropout. The experiments show that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms existing single-image learning or non-learning methods, but also is competitive to the denoising networks trained on external datasets."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMcxisYox4U,"Dynamic medical images are often limited in its application due to the large radiation doses and longer image scanning and reconstruction times. Existing methods attempt to reduce the volume samples in the dynamic sequence by interpolating the volumes between the acquired samples. However, these methods are limited to either 2D images and/or are unable to support large but periodic variations in the functional motion between the image volume samples. In this paper, we present a spatiotemporal volumetric interpolation network (SVIN) designed for 4D dynamic medical images. SVIN introduces dual networks: the first is the spatiotemporal motion network that leverages the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for unsupervised parametric volumetric registration to derive spatiotemporal motion field from a pair of image volumes; the second is the sequential volumetric interpolation network, which uses the derived motion field to interpolate image volumes, together with a new regression-based module to characterize the periodic motion cycles in functional organ structures. We also introduce an adaptive multi-scale architecture to capture the volumetric large anatomy motions. Experimental results demonstrated that our SVIN outperformed state-of-the-art temporal medical interpolation methods and natural video interpolation method that has been extended to support volumetric images. Code is available at [1]."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XIkhS1I54,"Cross-view geo-localization is the problem of estimating the position and orientation (latitude, longitude and azimuth angle) of a camera at ground level given a large-scale database of geo-tagged aerial (eg., satellite) images. Existing approaches treat the task as a pure location estimation problem by learning discriminative feature descriptors, but neglect orientation alignment. It is well-recognized that knowing the orientation between ground and aerial images can significantly reduce matching ambiguity between these two views, especially when the ground-level images have a limited Field of View (FoV) instead of a full field-of-view panorama. Therefore, we design a Dynamic Similarity Matching network to estimate cross-view orientation alignment during localization. In particular, we address the cross-view domain gap by applying a polar transform to the aerial images to approximately align the images up to an unknown azimuth angle. Then, a two-stream convolutional network is used to learn deep features from the ground and polar-transformed aerial images. Finally, we obtain the orientation by computing the correlation between cross-view features, which also provides a more accurate measure of feature similarity, improving location recall. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, we improve the top-1 location recall rate on the CVUSA dataset by a factor of 1.5x for panoramas with known orientation, by a factor of 3.3x for panoramas with unknown orientation, and by a factor of 6x for 180-degree FoV images with unknown orientation."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j74B_9VaJ8,"The success of image perturbations that are designed to fool image classifier is assessed in terms of both adversarial effect and visual imperceptibility. The conventional assumption on imperceptibility is that perturbations should strive for tight Lp-norm bounds in RGB space. In this work, we drop this assumption by pursuing an approach that exploits human color perception, and more specifically, minimizing perturbation size with respect to perceptual color distance. Our first approach, Perceptual Color distance C&W (PerC-C&W), extends the widely-used C&W approach and produces larger RGB perturbations. PerC-C&W is able to maintain adversarial strength, while contributing to imperceptibility. Our second approach, Perceptual Color distance Alternating Loss (PerC-AL), achieves the same outcome, but does so more efficiently by alternating between the classification loss and perceptual color difference when updating perturbations. Experimental evaluation shows PerC approaches outperform conventional Lp approaches in terms of robustness and transferability, and also demonstrates that the PerC distance can provide added value on top of existing structure-based methods to creating image perturbations."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gADedihdK8c,"We present a novel approach that converts partial and noisy RGB-D scans into high-quality 3D scene reconstructions by inferring unobserved scene geometry. Our approach is fully self-supervised and can hence be trained solely on incomplete, real-world scans. To achieve, self-supervision, we remove frames from a given (incomplete) 3D scan in order to make it even more incomplete; self-supervision is then formulated by correlating the two levels of partialness of the same scan while masking out regions that have never been observed. Through generalization across a large training set, we can then predict 3D scene completions even without seeing any 3D scan of entirely complete geometry. Combined with a new 3D sparse generative convolutional neural network architecture, our method is able to predict highly detailed surfaces in a coarse-to-fine hierarchical fashion that outperform existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in terms of reconstruction quality."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDV8X_z6Aac,"Unsupervised domain adaptation has attracted growing research attention on semantic segmentation. However, 1) most existing models cannot be directly applied into lesions transfer of medical images, due to the diverse appearances of same lesion among different datasets; 2) equal attention has been paid into all semantic representations instead of neglecting irrelevant knowledge, which leads to negative transfer of untransferable knowledge. To address these challenges, we develop a new unsupervised semantic transfer model including two complementary modules (i.e., T_D and T_F ) for endoscopic lesions segmentation, which can alternatively determine where and how to explore transferable domain-invariant knowledge between labeled source lesions dataset (e.g., gastroscope) and unlabeled target diseases dataset (e.g., enteroscopy). Specifically, T_D focuses on where to translate transferable visual information of medical lesions via residual transferability-aware bottleneck, while neglecting untransferable visual characterizations. Furthermore, T_F highlights how to augment transferable semantic features of various lesions and automatically ignore untransferable representations, which explores domain-invariant knowledge and in return improves the performance of T_D. To the end, theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on medical endoscopic dataset and several non-medical public datasets well demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmE6cWK9rpk,"Recent studies on automatic neural architecture search techniques have demonstrated significant performance, competitive to or even better than hand-crafted neural architectures. However, most of the existing search approaches tend to use residual structures and a concatenation connection between shallow and deep features. A resulted neural network model, therefore, is non-trivial for resource-constraint devices to execute since such a model requires large memory to store network parameters and intermediate feature maps along with excessive computing complexity. To address this challenge, we propose MemNAS, a novel growing and trimming based neural architecture search framework that optimizes not only performance but also memory requirement of an inference network. Specifically, in the search process, we consider running memory use, including network parameters and the essential intermediate feature maps memory requirement, as an optimization objective along with performance. Besides, to improve the accuracy of the search, we extract the correlation information among multiple candidate architectures to rank them and then choose the candidates with desired performance and memory efficiency. On the ImageNet classification task, our MemNAS achieves 75.4% accuracy, 0.7% higher than MobileNetV2 with 42.1% less memory requirement. Additional experiments confirm that the proposed MemNAS can perform well across the different targets of the trade-off between accuracy and memory consumption."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChvW59jM4O0,"On public benchmarks, current action recognition techniques have achieved great success. However, when used in real-world applications, e.g. sport analysis, which requires the capability of parsing an activity into phases and differentiating between subtly different actions, their performances remain far from being satisfactory. To take action recognition to a new level, we develop FineGym, a new dataset built on top of gymnasium videos. Compared to existing action recognition datasets, FineGym is distinguished in richness, quality, and diversity. In particular, it provides temporal annotations at both action and sub-action levels with a three-level semantic hierarchy. For example, a ""balance beam"" activity will be annotated as a sequence of elementary sub-actions derived from five sets: ""leap-jump-hop"", ""beam-turns"", ""flight-salto"", ""flight-handspring"", and ""dismount"", where the sub-action in each set will be further annotated with finely defined class labels. This new level of granularity presents significant challenges for action recognition, e.g. how to parse the temporal structures from a coherent action, and how to distinguish between subtly different action classes. We systematically investigates different methods on this dataset and obtains a number of interesting findings. We hope this dataset could advance research towards action understanding."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gpvnpt8oRA,"Modern image classification systems are often built on deep neural networks, which suffer from adversarial examples--images with deliberately crafted, imperceptible noise to mislead the network's classification. To defend against adversarial examples, a plausible idea is to obfuscate the network's gradient with respect to the input image. This general idea has inspired a long line of defense methods. Yet, almost all of them have proven vulnerable. We revisit this seemingly flawed idea from a radically different perspective. We embrace the omnipresence of adversarial examples and the numerical procedure of crafting them, and turn this harmful attacking process into a useful defense mechanism. Our defense method is conceptually simple: before feeding an input image for classification, transform it by finding an adversarial example on a pre-trained external model. We evaluate our method against a wide range of possible attacks. On both CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets, our method is significantly more robust than state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, in comparison to adversarial training, our method offers lower training cost as well as stronger robustness."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS9u28-2p7w,"We propose D3VO as a novel framework for monocular visual odometry that exploits deep networks on three levels -- deep depth, pose and uncertainty estimation. We first propose a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation network trained on stereo videos without any external supervision. In particular, it aligns the training image pairs into similar lighting condition with predictive brightness transformation parameters. Besides, we model the photometric uncertainties of pixels on the input images, which improves the depth estimation accuracy and provides a learned weighting function for the photometric residuals in direct (feature-less) visual odometry. Evaluation results show that the proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised depth estimation networks. D3VO tightly incorporates the predicted depth, pose and uncertainty into a direct visual odometry method to boost both the front-end tracking as well as the back-end non-linear optimization. We evaluate D3VO in terms of monocular visual odometry on both the KITTI odometry benchmark and the EuRoC MAV dataset. The results show that D3VO outperforms state-of-the-art traditional monocular VO methods by a large margin. It also achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art stereo/LiDAR odometry on KITTI and to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry on EuRoC MAV, while using only a single camera."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2-7j7uS0qo,"While most visual attention studies focus on bottom-up attention with restricted field-of-view, real-life situations are filled with embodied vision tasks. The role of attention is more significant in the latter due to the information overload, and attention to the most important regions is critical to the success of tasks. The effects of visual attention on task performance in this context have also been widely ignored. This research addresses a number of challenges to bridge this research gap, on both the data and model aspects. Specifically, we introduce the first dataset of top-down attention in immersive scenes. The Immersive Question-directed Visual Attention (IQVA) dataset features visual attention and corresponding task performance (i.e., answer correctness). It consists of 975 questions and answers collected from people viewing 360deg videos in a head-mounted display. Analyses of the data demonstrate a significant correlation between people's task performance and their eye movements, suggesting the role of attention in task performance. With that, a neural network is developed to encode the differences of correct and incorrect attention and jointly predict the two. The proposed attention model for the first time takes into account answer correctness, whose outputs naturally distinguish important regions from distractions. This study with new data and features may enable new tasks that leverage attention and answer correctness, and inspire new research that reveals the process behind decision making in performing various tasks."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNWA-EOBwWw,"We propose novel dynamic multiscale graph neural networks (DMGNN) to predict 3D skeleton-based human motions. The core idea of DMGNN is to use a multiscale graph to comprehensively model the internal relations of a human body for motion feature learning. This multiscale graph is adaptive during training and dynamic across network layers. Based on this graph, we propose a multiscale graph computational unit (MGCU) to extract features at individual scales and fuse features across scales. The entire model is action-category-agnostic and follows an encoder-decoder framework. The encoder consists of a sequence of MGCUs to learn motion features. The decoder uses a proposed graph-based gate recurrent unit to generate future poses. Extensive experiments show that the proposed DMGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short and long-term predictions on the datasets of Human 3.6M and CMU Mocap. We further investigate the learned multiscale graphs for the interpretability. The codes could be downloaded from https://github.com/limaosen0/DMGNN."

Existing works either address one part of this problem or focus on independent objects. In this paper, we bridge the gap between understanding and reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end solution to jointly reconstruct room layout, object bounding boxes and meshes from a single image. Instead of separately resolving scene understanding and object reconstruction, our method builds upon a holistic scene context and proposes a coarse-to-fine hierarchy with three components: 1. room layout with camera pose; 2. 3D object bounding boxes; 3. object meshes. We argue that understanding the context of each component can assist the task of parsing the others, which enables joint understanding and reconstruction. The experiments on the SUN RGB-D and Pix3D datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing methods in indoor layout estimation, 3D object detection and mesh reconstruction."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wh5XXdKUBI,"Most existing methods do not explicitly formulate the mutual guidance between vision and language. In this work, we propose a bi-directional relationship inferring network (BRINet) to model the dependencies of cross-modal information. In detail, the vision-guided linguistic attention is used to learn the adaptive linguistic context corresponding to each visual region. Combining with the language-guided visual attention, a bi-directional cross-modal attention module (BCAM) is built to learn the relationship between multi-modal features. Thus, the ultimate semantic context of the target object and referring expression can be represented accurately and consistently. Moreover, a gated bi-directional fusion module (GBFM) is designed to integrate the multi-level features where a gate function is used to guide the bi-directional flow of multi-level information. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics."

Despite model size reduction, achieving performance enhancement on devices is, however, still challenging mainly due to the irregular representations of sparse matrix formats. This paper proposes a new weight representation scheme for Sparse Quantized Neural Networks, specifically achieved by fine-grained and unstructured pruning method. The representation is encrypted in a structured regular format, which can be efficiently decoded through XOR-gate network during inference in a parallel manner. We demonstrate various deep learning models that can be compressed and represented by our proposed format with fixed and high compression ratio. For example, for fully-connected layers of AlexNet on ImageNet dataset, we can represent the sparse weights by only 0.28 bits/weight for 1-bit quantization and 91% pruning rate with a fixed decoding rate and full memory bandwidth usage. Decoding through XOR-gate network can be performed without any model accuracy degradation with additional patch data associated with small overhead."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZriYZNe_m0,"In this paper, we propose a novel real-time 6D object pose estimation framework, named G2L-Net. Our network operates on point clouds from RGB-D detection in a divide-and-conquer fashion. Specifically, our network consists of three steps. First, we extract the coarse object point cloud from the RGB-D image by 2D detection. Second, we feed the coarse object point cloud to a translation localization network to perform 3D segmentation and object translation prediction. Third, via the predicted segmentation and translation, we transfer the fine object point cloud into a local canonical coordinate, in which we train a rotation localization network to estimate initial object rotation. In the third step, we define point-wise embedding vector features to capture viewpoint-aware information. To calculate more accurate rotation, we adopt a rotation residual estimator to estimate the residual between initial rotation and ground truth, which can boost initial pose estimation performance. Our proposed G2L-Net is real-time despite the fact multiple steps are stacked via the proposed coarse-to-fine framework. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that G2L-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and speed."

In contrast to existing approaches that learn spatial transformations from training data in the high dimensional imaging space, we develop a new registration network entirely in a low dimensional bandlimited space. This dramatically reduces the computational cost and memory footprint of an expensive training and inference. To achieve this goal, we first introduce complex-valued operations and representations of neural architectures that provide key components for learning-based registration models. We then construct an explicit loss function of transformation fields fully characterized in a bandlimited space with much fewer parameterizations. Experimental results show that our method is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning based image registration methods, while producing equally accurate alignment. We demonstrate our algorithm in two different applications of image registration: 2D synthetic data and 3D real brain magnetic resonance (MR) images."

To solve those two problems in automatic medical segmentation, we propose a novel structure boundary preserving segmentation framework. To this end, the boundary key point selection algorithm is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the key points on the structural boundary of the target object are estimated. Then, a boundary preserving block (BPB) with the boundary key point map is applied for predicting the structure boundary of the target object. Further, for embedding experts' knowledge in the fully automatic segmentation, we propose a novel shape boundary-aware evaluator (SBE) with the ground-truth structure information indicated by experts. The proposed SBE could give feedback to the segmentation network based on the structure boundary key point. The proposed method is general and flexible enough to be built on top of any deep learning-based segmentation network. We demonstrate that the proposed method could surpass the state-of-the-art segmentation network and improve the accuracy of three different segmentation network models on different types of medical image datasets."

To capture robust movement patterns from these graphs, long-range and multi-scale context aggregation and spatial-temporal dependency modeling are critical aspects of a powerful feature extractor. However, existing methods have limitations in achieving (1) unbiased long-range joint relationship modeling under multi-scale operators and (2) unobstructed cross-spacetime information flow for capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies. In this work, we present (1) a simple method to disentangle multi-scale graph convolutions and (2) a unified spatial-temporal graph convolutional operator named G3D. The proposed multi-scale aggregation scheme disentangles the importance of nodes in different neighborhoods for effective long-range modeling. The proposed G3D module leverages dense cross-spacetime edges as skip connections for direct information propagation across the spatial-temporal graph. By coupling these proposals, we develop a powerful feature extractor named MS-G3D based on which our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and Kinetics Skeleton 400."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r5ekdI33OQ,"Recent research has made the surprising finding that state-of-the-art deep learning models sometimes fail to generalize to small variations of the input. Adversarial training has been shown to be an effective approach to overcome this problem. However, its application has been limited to enforcing invariance to analytically defined transformations like lp-norm bounded perturbations. Such perturbations do not necessarily cover plausible real-world variations that preserve the semantics of the input (such as a change in lighting conditions). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to express and formalize robustness to these kinds of real-world transformations of the input. The two key ideas underlying our formulation are (1) leveraging disentangled representations of the input to define different factors of variations, and (2) generating new input images by adversarially composing the representations of different images. We use a StyleGAN model to demonstrate the efficacy of this framework. Specifically, we leverage the disentangled latent representations computed by a StyleGAN model to generate perturbations of an image that are similar to real-world variations (like adding make-up, or changing the skin-tone of a person) and train models to be invariant to these perturbations. Extensive experiments show that our method improves generalization and reduces the effect of spurious correlations (reducing the error rate of a ""smile"" detector by 21% for example)."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmEkrRmdnVE,"The key for fusion based hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution (SR) is to infer the posteriori of a latent HSI using appropriate image prior and likelihood that depends on degeneration. However, in practice the priors of high-dimensional HSIs can be extremely complicated and the degeneration is often unknown. Consequently most existing approaches that assume a shallow hand-crafted image prior and a pre-defined degeneration, fail to well generalize in real applications. To tackle this problem, we present an unsupervised adaptation learning (UAL) framework. Instead of directly modelling the complicated image prior, we propose to first implicitly learn a general image prior using deep networks and then adapt it to a specific HSI. Following this idea, we develop a two-stage SR network that leverages two consecutive modules: a fusion module and an adaptation module, to recover the latent HSI in a coarse-to-fine scheme. The fusion module is pretrained in a supervised manner on synthetic data to capture a spatial-spectral prior that is general across most HSIs. To adapt the learned general prior to the specific HSI under unknown degeneration, we introduce a simple degeneration network to assist learning both the adaptation module and the degeneration in an unsupervised way. In this way, the resultant image-specific prior and the estimated degeneration can benefit the inference of a more accurate posteriori, thereby increasing generalization capacity. To verify the efficacy of UAL, we extensively evaluate it on four benchmark datasets and report strong results that surpass existing approaches."

However, we show that existing techniques perform poorly when labeled data are severely limited. To address the problem of semi-supervised learning in the presence of severely limited labeled samples, we propose a new framework, called   Shoestring , that incorporates metric learning into the paradigm of graph-based semi-supervised learning. In particular, our base model consists of a graph embedding network, followed by a metric learning network that learns a semantic metric space to represent the semantic similarity between the sparsely labeled and large numbers of unlabeled samples. Then the classification can be performed by clustering the unlabeled samples according to the learned semantic space. We empirically demonstrate Shoestring's superiority over many baselines, including graph convolutional networks, label propagation and their recent label-efficient variations (IGCN and GLP). We show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for node classification in the low-data regime. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on image classification tasks in the few-shot learning regime, with significant gains on miniImageNet (2.57%~3.59%) and tieredImageNet (1.05%~2.70%)."

The cornerstone of the proposed method is a Cholesky Block that enables modeling dependencies among mixture distributions in a differentiable manner where we maintain the distribution over the network weights. We first provide illustrative examples in both regression and classification tasks to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Existing methods for point cloud segmentation require a large amount of fully labeled data. Using advanced depth sensors, collection of large scale 3D dataset is no longer a cumbersome process. However, manually producing point-level label on the large scale dataset is time and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised approach to predict point-level results using weak labels on 3D point clouds. We introduce our multi-path region mining module to generate pseudo point-level labels from a classification network trained with weak labels. It mines the localization cues for each class from various aspects of the network feature using different attention modules. Then, we use the point-level pseudo label to train a point cloud segmentation network in a fully supervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that uses cloud-level weak labels on raw 3D space to train a point cloud semantic segmentation network. In our setting, the 3D weak labels only indicate the classes that appeared in our input sample. We discuss both scene- and subcloud-level weakly labels on raw 3D point cloud data and perform in-depth experiments on them. On ScanNet dataset, our result trained with subcloud-level labels is compatible with some fully supervised methods."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7bTrNIcqw,"Six degree-of-freedom pose estimation of a known object in a single image is a long-standing computer vision objective. It is classically posed as a correspondence problem between a known geometric model, such as a CAD model, and image locations. If a CAD model is not available, it is possible to use multi-view visual reconstruction methods to create a geometric model, and use this in the same manner. Instead, we propose a learning-based method whose input is a collection of images of a target object, and whose output is the pose of the object in a novel view. At inference time, our method maps from the RoI features of the input image to a dense collection of object-centric 3D coordinates, one per pixel. This dense 2D-3D mapping is then used to determine 6dof pose using standard PnP plus RANSAC. The model that maps 2D to object 3D coordinates is established at training time by automatically discovering and matching image landmarks that are consistent across multiple views. We show that this method eliminates the requirement for a 3D CAD model (needed by classical geometry-based methods and state-of-the-art learning-based methods alike) but still achieves performance on a par with the prior art."

This happens when they fail to generalize outside the manifold of anomaly-free training data. The intrinsic uncertainty in the student networks is used as an additional scoring function that indicates anomalies. We compare our method to a large number of existing deep learning based methods for unsupervised anomaly detection.

In this paper, we propose to directly approximate the perceptual function performed by human observers completing a visual detection task. Specifically, we present a novel methodology for learning to detect image transformations visible to human observers through approximating perceptual thresholds. To do this, we carry out a subjective two-alternative forced-choice study to estimate perceptual thresholds of human observers detecting local exposure shifts in images. We then leverage transformation equivariant representation learning to overcome issues of limited perceptual data. This representation is then used to train a dense convolutional classifier capable of detecting local suprathreshold exposure shifts - a distortion common to image composites. In this context, our model can approximate perceptual thresholds with an average error of 0.1148 exposure stops between empirical and predicted thresholds. It can also be trained to detect a range of different local transformations."

In this paper, we introduce BlendedMVS, a novel large-scale dataset, to provide sufficient training ground truth for learning-based MVS. To create the dataset, we apply a 3D reconstruction pipeline to recover high-quality textured meshes from images of well-selected scenes. Then, we render these mesh models to color images and depth maps. To introduce the ambient lighting information during training, the rendered color images are further blended with the input images to generate the training input. Our dataset contains over 17k high-resolution images covering a variety of scenes, including cities, architectures, sculptures and small objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlendedMVS endows the trained model with significantly better generalization ability compared with other MVS datasets.

However, existing methods rely heavily on supervised learning using large quantities of annotated image samples, which are more costly to collect for important people detection than for individual entity recognition (i.e., object recognition). To overcome this problem, we propose learning important people detection on partially annotated images. Our approach iteratively learns to assign pseudo-labels to individuals in un-annotated images and learns to update the important people detection model based on data with both labels and pseudo-labels. To alleviate the pseudo-labelling imbalance problem, we introduce a ranking strategy for pseudo-label estimation, and also introduce two weighting strategies: one for weighting the confidence that individuals are important people to strengthen the learning on important people and the other for neglecting noisy unlabelled images (i.e., images without any important people). We have collected two large-scale datasets for evaluation. The extensive experimental results clearly confirm the efficacy of our method attained by leveraging unlabelled images for improving the performance of important people detection."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy6PDTS4_JQ,"Humans perceive the 3D world as a set of distinct objects that are characterized by various low-level (geometry, reflectance) and high-level (connectivity, adjacency, symmetry) properties. Recent methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrated impressive progress in 3D reconstruction, even when using a single 2D image as input. However, the majority of these methods focuses on recovering the local 3D geometry of an object without considering its part-based decomposition or relations between parts. We address this challenging problem by proposing a novel formulation that allows to jointly recover the geometry of a 3D object as a set of primitives as well as their latent hierarchical structure without part-level supervision. Our model recovers the higher level structural decomposition of various objects in the form of a binary tree of primitives, where simple parts are represented with fewer primitives and more complex parts are modeled with more components. Our experiments on the ShapeNet and D-FAUST datasets demonstrate that considering the organization of parts indeed facilitates reasoning about 3D geometry."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhf1Z7N8kDg,"Light field (LF) images acquired by hand-held devices usually suffer from low spatial resolution as the limited sampling resources have to be shared with the angular dimension. LF spatial super-resolution (SR) thus becomes an indispensable part of the LF camera processing pipeline. The high-dimensionality characteristic and complex geometrical structure of LF images makes the problem more challenging than traditional single-image SR. The performance of existing methods are still limited as they fail to thoroughly explore the coherence among LF views and are insufficient in accurately preserving the parallax structure of the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based LF spatial SR framework, in which each view of an LF image is first individually super-resolved by exploring the complementary information among views with combinatorial geometry embedding. For accurate preservation of the parallax structure among the reconstructed views, a regularization network trained over a structure-aware loss function is subsequently appended to enforce correct parallax relationships over the intermediate estimation. Our proposed approach is evaluated over datasets with a large number of testing images including both synthetic and real-world scenes. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, i.e., our method not only improves the average PSNR by more than 1.0 dB but also preserves more accurate parallax details, at a lower computation cost."

However, general semantic segmentation methods mainly focus on scale variation in the natural scene, with inadequate consideration of the other two problems that usually happen in the large area earth observation scene. In this paper, we argue that the problems lie on the lack of foreground modeling and propose a foreground-aware relation network (FarSeg) from the perspectives of relation-based and optimization-based foreground modeling, to alleviate the above two problems. From perspective of relation, FarSeg enhances the discrimination of foreground features via foreground-correlated contexts associated by learning foreground-scene relation. Meanwhile, from perspective of optimization, a foreground-aware optimization is proposed to focus on foreground examples and hard examples of background during training for a balanced optimization. The experimental results obtained using a large scale dataset suggest that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art general semantic segmentation methods and achieves a better trade-off between speed and accuracy."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8Y5O3JFdgY,"The learning of the deep networks largely relies on the data with human-annotated labels. In some label insufficient situations, the performance degrades on the decision boundary with high data density. A common solution is to directly minimize the Shannon Entropy, but the side effect caused by entropy minimization, i.e., reduction of the prediction diversity, is mostly ignored. To address this issue, we reinvestigate the structure of classification output matrix of a randomly selected data batch. We find by theoretical analysis that the prediction discriminability and diversity could be separately measured by the Frobenius-norm and rank of the batch output matrix. Besides, the nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the Frobenius-norm, and a convex approximation of the matrix rank. Accordingly, to improve both discriminability and diversity, we propose Batch Nuclear-norm Maximization (BNM) on the output matrix. BNM could boost the learning under typical label insufficient learning scenarios, such as semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation and open domain recognition. On these tasks, extensive experimental results show that BNM outperforms competitors and works well with existing well-known methods. The code is available at https://github.com/cuishuhao/BNM"

Due to its complexity, we propose a deep neural network model based on a semantic divide-and-conquer approach. Our model decomposes a scene into semantic segments, such as object instances and background stuff classes, and then predicts a scale and shift invariant depth map for each semantic segment in a canonical space. Semantic segments of the same category share the same depth decoder, so the global depth prediction task is decomposed into a series of category-specific ones, which are simpler to learn and easier to generalize to new scene types. Finally, our model stitches each local depth segment by predicting its scale and shift based on the global context of the image. The model is trained end-to-end using a multi-task loss for panoptic segmentation and depth prediction, and is therefore able to leverage large-scale panoptic segmentation datasets to boost its semantic understanding.

In this work, we examine the insecurity of current best-performing ReID models by proposing a learning-to-mis-rank formulation to perturb the ranking of the system output. As the cross-dataset transferability is crucial in the ReID domain, we also perform a back-box attack by developing a novel multi-stage network architecture that pyramids the features of different levels to extract general and transferable features for the adversarial perturbations. Our method can control the number of malicious pixels by using differentiable multi-shot sampling. To guarantee the inconspicuousness of the attack, we also propose a new perception loss to achieve better visual quality. Extensive experiments on four of the largest ReID benchmarks (i.e., Market1501, CUHK03, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17) not only show the effectiveness of our method, but also provides directions of the future improvement in the robustness of ReID systems.

While of practical importance, estimating the pose of hands and objects during interactions is challenging due to the large mutual occlusions that occur during manipulation. Recent efforts have been directed towards fully-supervised methods that require large amounts of labeled training samples. Collecting 3D ground-truth data for hand-object interactions, however, is costly, tedious, and error-prone. To overcome this challenge we present a method to leverage photometric consistency across time when annotations are only available for a sparse subset of frames in a video. Our model is trained end-to-end on color images to jointly reconstruct hands and objects in 3D by inferring their poses. Given our estimated reconstructions, we differentiably render the optical flow between pairs of adjacent images and use it within the network to warp one frame to another. We then apply a self-supervised photometric loss that relies on the visual consistency between nearby images. We achieve state-of-the-art results on 3D hand-object reconstruction benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach allows us to improve the pose estimation accuracy by leveraging information from neighboring frames in low-data regimes."

Existing models usually treat RGB and depth as independent information and design separate networks for feature extraction from each. Such schemes can easily be constrained by a limited amount of training data or over-reliance on an elaborately-designed training process. In contrast, our JL-DCF learns from both RGB and depth inputs through a Siamese network. To this end, we propose two effective components: joint learning (JL), and densely-cooperative fusion (DCF). The JL module provides robust saliency feature learning, while the latter is introduced for complementary feature discovery. Comprehensive experiments on four popular metrics show that the designed framework yields a robust RGB-D saliency detector with good generalization. As a result, JL-DCF significantly advances the top-1 D3Net model by an average of  1.9% (S-measure) across six challenging datasets, showing that the proposed framework offers a potential solution for real-world applications and could provide more insight into the cross-modality complementarity task.

Unlike artificially collected datasets, long-tailed data are naturally existed in the real-world and thus more realistic. To deal with the class imbalance problem, we introduce an Inflated Episodic Memory (IEM) for long-tailed visual recognition. First, our IEM augments the convolutional neural networks with categorical representative features for rapid learning on tail classes. In traditional few-shot learning, a single prototype is usually leveraged to represent a category. However, long-tailed data has higher intra-class variances. It could be challenging to learn a single prototype for one category. Thus, we introduce IEM to store the most discriminative feature for each category individually. Besides, the memory banks are updated independently, which further decreases the chance of learning skewed classifiers. Second, we introduce a novel region self-attention mechanism for multi-scale spatial feature map encoding. It is beneficial to incorporate more discriminative features to improve generalization on tail classes. We propose to encode local feature maps at multiple scales, and the spatial contextual information should be aggregated at the same time. Equipped with IEM and region self-attention, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on four standard long-tailed image recognition benchmarks.

While current verification methods mainly focus on the l_p-norm threat model of the input instances, robustness verification against semantic adversarial attacks inducing large l_p-norm perturbations, such as color shifting and lighting adjustment, are beyond their capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantify-NN, a model-agnostic and generic robustness verification approach against semantic perturbations for neural networks. By simply inserting our proposed semantic perturbation layers (SP-layers) to the input layer of any given model, Semantify-NN is model-agnostic, and any l_p-norm based verification tools can be used to verify the model robustness against semantic perturbations. We illustrate the principles of designing the SP-layers and provide examples including semantic perturbations to image classification in the space of hue, saturation, lightness, brightness, contrast and rotation, respectively. In addition, an efficient refinement technique is proposed to further significantly improve the semantic certificate. Experiments on various network architectures and different datasets demonstrate the superior verification performance of Semantify-NN over l_p-norm-based verification frameworks that naively convert semantic perturbation to l_p-norm. The results show that Semantify-NN can support robustness verification against a wide range of semantic perturbations."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In2Iv3vsWC4,"In this paper, we propose a method of visualizing 3D motion with zero latency. This method achieves motion visualization by projecting special high-frequency light patterns on moving objects without using any feedback mechanisms. For this objective, we focus on the time integration of light rays in the sensing system of observers. It is known that the visual system of human observers integrates light rays in a certain period. Similarly, the image sensor in a camera integrates light rays during the exposure time. Thus, our method embeds multiple images into a time-varying light field, such that the observer of the time-varying light field observes completely different images according to the dynamic motion of the scene. Based on this concept, we propose a method of generating special high-frequency patterns of projector lights. After projection onto target objects with projectors, the image observed on the target changes automatically depending on the motion of the objects and without any scene sensing and data analysis. In other words, we achieve motion visualization without the time delay incurred during sensing and computing."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBO8olcWHvE,"We study how to train a student deep neural network for visual recognition by distilling knowledge from a blackbox teacher model in a data-efficient manner. Progress on this problem can significantly reduce the dependence on large-scale datasets for learning high-performing visual recognition models. There are two major challenges. One is that the number of queries into the teacher model should be minimized to save computational and/or financial costs. The other is that the number of images used for the knowledge distillation should be small; otherwise, it violates our expectation of reducing the dependence on large-scale datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose an approach that blends mixup and active learning. The former effectively augments the few unlabeled images by a big pool of synthetic images sampled from the convex hull of the original images, and the latter actively chooses from the pool hard examples for the student neural network and query their labels from the teacher model. We validate our approach with extensive experiments."

Recently, there is a trend of using very deep feedforward neural networks to model the 3D coordinates of joints without considering the computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective semantics-guided neural network (SGN) for skeleton-based action recognition. We explicitly introduce the high level semantics of joints (joint type and frame index) into the network to enhance the feature representation capability. In addition, we exploit the relationship of joints hierarchically through two modules, i.e., a joint-level module for modeling the correlations of joints in the same frame and a framelevel module for modeling the dependencies of frames by taking the joints in the same frame as a whole. A strong baseline is proposed to facilitate the study of this field. With an order of magnitude smaller model size than most previous works, SGN achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the NTU60, NTU120, and SYSU datasets."

Although adversarial training is one of the most effective forms of defense against adversarial examples, unfortunately, a large gap exists between test accuracy and training accuracy in adversarial training. In this paper, we identify Adversarial Feature Overfitting (AFO), which may cause poor adversarially robust generalization, and we show that adversarial training can overshoot the optimal point in terms of robust generalization, leading to AFO in our simple Gaussian model. Considering these theoretical results, we present soft labeling as a solution to the AFO problem. Furthermore, we propose Adversarial Vertex mixup (AVmixup), a soft-labeled data augmentation approach for improving adversarially robust generalization. We complement our theoretical analysis with experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet, and show that AVmixup significantly improves the robust generalization performance and that it reduces the trade-off between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness."

We propose a dense attribute-based attention mechanism that for each attribute focuses on the most relevant image regions, obtaining attribute-based features. Instead of aligning a global feature vector of an image with its associated class semantic vector, we propose an attribute embedding technique that aligns each attribute-based feature with its attribute semantic vector. Hence, we compute a vector of attribute scores, for the presence of each attribute in an image, whose similarity with the true class semantic vector is maximized. Moreover, we adjust each attribute score using an attention mechanism over attributes to better capture the discriminative power of different attributes. To tackle the challenge of bias towards seen classes during testing, we propose a new self-calibration loss that adjusts the probability of unseen classes to account for the training bias. We conduct experiments on three popular datasets of CUB, SUN and AWA2 as well as the large-scale DeepFashion dataset, showing that our model significantly improves the state of the art."

In this work, we propose a method for snapshot HDR imaging by learning an optical HDR encoding in a single image which maps saturated highlights into neighboring unsaturated areas using a diffractive optical element (DOE). We propose a novel rank-1 parameterization of the proposed DOE which avoids vast trainable parameters and keeps high frequencies' encoding compared with conventional end-to-end design methods. We further propose a reconstruction network tailored to this rank-1 parametrization for recovery of clipped information from the encoded measurements. The proposed end-to-end framework is validated through simulation and real-world experiments and improves the PSNR by more than 7 dB over state-of-the-art end-to-end designs."

Despite extensive research over past years, effectively deploying MIL remains an open and challenging problem, especially when the commonly assumed standard multiple instance (SMI) assumption is not satisfied. In this paper, we propose a multiple instance learning method based on deep graph convolutional network and feature selection (FS-GCN-MIL) for histopathological image classification. The proposed method consists of three components, including instance-level feature extraction, instance-level feature selection, and bag-level classification. We develop a self-supervised learning mechanism to train the feature extractor based on a combination model of variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN). Additionally, we propose a novel instance-level feature selection method to select the discriminative instance features. Furthermore, we employ a graph convolutional network (GCN) for learning the bag-level representation and then performing the classification. We apply the proposed method in the prediction of lymph node metastasis using histopathological images of colorectal cancer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

Unlike previous methods that separately optimize the neural network architecture, pruning policy, and quantization policy, we design to optimize them in a joint manner. To deal with the larger design space it brings, we devise to train a quantization-aware accuracy predictor that is fed to the evolutionary search to select the best fit. Since directly training such a predictor requires time-consuming quantization data collection, we propose to use predictor-transfer technique to get the quantization-aware predictor: we first generate a large dataset of  pairs by sampling a pretrained unified supernet and doing direct evaluation; then we use these data to train an accuracy predictor without quantization, further transferring its weights to train the quantization-aware predictor, which largely reduces the quantization data collection time. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show the benefits of this joint design methodology: the model searched by our method maintains the same level accuracy as ResNet34 8-bit model while saving 8x BitOps; we obtain the same level accuracy as MobileNetV2+HAQ while achieving 2x/1.3x latency/energy saving; the marginal search cost of joint optimization for a new deployment scenario outperforms separate optimizations using ProxylessNAS+AMC+HAQ by 2.3% accuracy while reducing 600x GPU hours and CO2 emission."

Alongside other adversarial defense approaches being investigated, there has been a very recent interest in improving adversarial robustness in deep neural networks through the introduction of perturbations during the training process. However, such methods leverage fixed, pre-defined perturbations and require significant hyper-parameter tuning that makes them very difficult to leverage in a general fashion. In this study, we introduce Learn2Perturb, an end-to-end feature perturbation learning approach for improving the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. More specifically, we introduce novel perturbation-injection modules that are incorporated at each layer to perturb the feature space and increase uncertainty in the network. This feature perturbation is performed at both the training and the inference stages. Furthermore, inspired by the Expectation-Maximization, an alternating back-propagation training algorithm is introduced to train the network and noise parameters consecutively. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show that the proposed Learn2Perturb method can result in deep neural networks which are 4-7% more robust on l_inf FGSM and PDG adversarial attacks and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art against l_2 C&W attack and a wide range of well-known black-box attacks."

In this work, we show that existing state-of-the-art deep 3D models are extremely vulnerable to isometry transformations. Armed with the Thompson Sampling, we develop a black-box attack with success rate over 95% on ModelNet40 data set. Incorporating with the Restricted Isometry Property, we propose a novel framework of white-box attack on top of spectral norm based perturbation. In contrast to previous works, our adversarial samples are experimentally shown to be strongly transferable. Evaluated on a sequence of prevailing 3D models, our white-box attack achieves success rates from 98.88% to 100%. It maintains a successful attack rate over 95% even within an imperceptible rotation range [+-2.81*]."

Discovering a well-crafted copy-move forgery in images can be very challenging for both humans and machines; for example, an object on a uniform background can be replaced by an image patch of the same background. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network with a dual-order attention model to detect and localize copy-move forgeries. In the generator, the first-order attention is designed to capture copy-move location information, and the second-order attention exploits more discriminative features for the patch co-occurrence. Both attention maps are extracted from the affinity matrix and are used to fuse location-aware and co-occurrence features for the final detection and localization branches of the network. The discriminator network is designed to further ensure more accurate localization results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose such a network architecture with the 1st-order attention mechanism from the affinity matrix. We have performed extensive experimental validation and our state-of-the-art results strongly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9KhudotR54,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for low-dimensional regular grids will unfortunately lead to non-optimal solutions for analyzing spherical images, due to their different geometrical properties from planar images. In this paper, we generalize the grid-based CNNs to a non-Euclidean space by taking into account the geometry of spherical surfaces and propose a Spherical Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) to encode rotation equivariant representations. Specifically, we propose a spherical graph construction criterion showing that a graph needs to be regular by evenly covering the spherical surfaces in order to design a rotation equivariant graph convolutional layer. For the practical case where the perfectly regular graph does not exist, we design two quantitative measures to evaluate the degree of irregularity for a spherical graph. The Geodesic ICOsahedral Pixelation (GICOPix) is adopted to construct spherical graphs with the minimum degree of irregularity compared to the current popular pixelation schemes. In addition, we design a hierarchical pooling layer to keep the rotation-equivariance, followed by a transition layer to enforce the invariance to the rotations for spherical image classification. We evaluate the proposed graph convolutional layers with different pixelations schemes in terms of equivariance errors. We also assess the effectiveness of the proposed SGCN in fulfilling rotation-invariance by the invariance error of the transition layers and recognizing the spherical images and 3D objects."

We optimize both the forward and backward pass of our rendering layer to make it run efficiently with affordable memory consumption on a commodity graphics card. Our rendering method is fully differentiable such that losses can be directly computed on the rendered 2D observations, and the gradients can be propagated backward to optimize the 3D geometry. We show that our rendering method can effectively reconstruct accurate 3D shapes from various inputs, such as sparse depth and multi-view images, through inverse optimization. With the geometry based reasoning, our 3D shape prediction methods show excellent generalization capability and robustness against various noises."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fbHXV-ZmKY,"MRI with multiple protocols is commonly used for diagnosis, but it suffers from a long acquisition time, which yields the image quality vulnerable to say motion artifacts. To accelerate, various methods have been proposed to reconstruct full images from under-sampled k-space data. However, these algorithms are inadequate for two main reasons. Firstly, aliasing artifacts generated in the image domain are structural and non-local, so that sole image domain restoration is insufficient. Secondly, though MRI comprises multiple protocols during one exam, almost all previous studies only employ the reconstruction of an individual protocol using a highly distorted undersampled image as input, leaving the use of fully-sampled short protocol (say T1) as complementary information highly underexplored. In this work, we address the above two limitations by proposing a Dual Domain Recurrent Network (DuDoRNet) with deep T1 prior embedded to simultaneously recover k-space and images for accelerating the acquisition of MRI with a long imaging protocol. Specifically, a Dilated Residual Dense Network (DRDNet) is customized for dual domain restorations from undersampled MRI data. Extensive experiments on different sampling patterns and acceleration rates demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and can reconstruct high quality MRI."

To deal with the challenge, we propose a self-adaptive hyper network architecture to blind assess image quality in the wild. We separate the IQA procedure into three stages including content understanding, perception rule learning and quality predicting. After extracting image semantics, perception rule is established adaptively by a hyper network, and then adopted by a quality prediction network. In our model, image quality can be estimated in a self-adaptive manner, thus generalizes well on diverse images captured in the wild. Experimental results verify that our approach not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on challenging authentic image databases but also achieves competing performances on synthetic image databases, though it is not explicitly designed for the synthetic task."

However, the acquisition of accurate and large ground truth data sets to model these fully supervised methods is a major challenge for the further development of the area. Self-supervised methods trained with monocular videos constitute one the most promising approaches to mitigate the challenge mentioned above due to the wide-spread availability of training data. Consequently, they have been intensively studied, where the main ideas explored consist of different types of model architectures, loss functions, and occlusion masks to address non-rigid motion. In this paper, we propose two new ideas to improve self-supervised monocular trained depth estimation: 1) self-attention, and 2) discrete disparity prediction. Compared with the usual localised convolution operation, self-attention can explore a more general contextual information that allows the inference of similar disparity values at non-contiguous regions of the image. Discrete disparity prediction has been shown by fully supervised methods to provide a more robust and sharper depth estimation than the more common continuous disparity prediction, besides enabling the estimation of depth uncertainty. We show that the extension of the state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular trained depth estimator Monodepth2 with these two ideas allows us to design a model that produces the best results in the field in KITTI 2015 and Make3D, closing the gap with respect self-supervised stereo training and fully supervised approaches."

The filtered output represents the temporal gradient of the captured space-time volume, which can be viewed as motion-compensated event frames with high resolution and low noise. Therefore, the output can be widely applied to many existing event-based algorithms that are highly dependent on spatial resolution and noise robustness.

There is an increased demand for deploying DNNs on devices that do not have abundant resources such as memory and computation units. Recently, network compression through a variety of techniques such as pruning and quantization have been proposed to reduce the resource requirement. A key parameter that all existing compression techniques are sensitive to is the compression ratio (e.g., pruning sparsity, quantization bitwidth) of each layer. Traditional solutions treat the compression ratios of each layer as hyper-parameters, and tune them using human heuristic. Recent researchers start using black-box hyper-parameter optimizations, but they will introduce new hyper-parameters and have efficiency issue. In this paper, we propose a framework to jointly prune and quantize the DNNs automatically according to a target model size without using any hyper-parameters to manually set the compression ratio for each layer.

However, leading methods using standard fully convolutional network workflows that are challenged when the number of OARs becomes large, e.g. > 40. For such scenarios, insights can be gained from the stratification approaches seen in manual clinical OAR delineation. This is the goal of our work, where we introduce stratified organ at risk segmentation (SOARS), an approach that stratifies OARs into anchor, mid-level, and small & hard (S&H) categories. SOARS stratifies across two dimensions. The first dimension is that distinct processing pipelines are used for each OAR category. In particular, inspired by clinical practices, anchor OARs are used to guide the mid-level and S&H categories. The second dimension is that distinct network architectures are used to manage the significant contrast, size, and anatomy variations between different OARs. We use differentiable neural architecture search (NAS), allowing the network to choose among 2D, 3D or Pseudo-3D convolutions. Extensive 4-fold cross-validation on 142 H&N cancer patients with 42 manually labeled OARs, the most comprehensive OAR dataset to date, demonstrates that both pipeline- and NAS-stratification significantly improves quantitative performance over the state-of-the-art (from 69.52% to 73.68% in absolute Dice scores). Thus, SOARS provides a powerful and principled means to manage the highly complex segmentation space of OARs."

In this setting, we find that existing domain translation approaches are difficult to train and offer little advantage over simple baselines that use a mix of real and synthetic data. A key failure mode is that real-world images contain novel objects and clutter not present in synthetic training. This high-level domain shift isn't handled by existing image translation models. Based on these observations, we develop an attention module that learns to identify and remove difficult out-of-domain regions in real images in order to improve depth prediction for a model trained primarily on synthetic data.

However, several recent works have shown that in practical scenarios, where the test data mismatch the training data (e.g. when the downscaling kernel is not the bicubic kernel or is not available at training), the leading DNN methods suffer from a huge performance drop. Inspired by the literature on generalized sampling, in this work we propose a method for improving the performance of DNNs that have been trained with a fixed kernel on observations acquired by other kernels. For a known kernel, we design a closed-form correction filter that modifies the low-resolution image to match one which is obtained by another kernel (e.g. bicubic), and thus improves the results of existing pre-trained DNNs. For an unknown kernel, we extend this idea and propose an algorithm for blind estimation of the required correction filter.

Although current approaches have demonstrated the potential in real world settings, they still fail to produce reconstructions with the level of detail often present in the input images. We argue that this limitation stems primarily form two conflicting requirements; accurate predictions require large context, but precise predictions require high resolution. Due to memory limitations in current hardware, previous approaches tend to take low resolution images as input to cover large spatial context, and produce less precise (or low resolution) 3D estimates as a result. We address this limitation by formulating a multi-level architecture that is end-to-end trainable. A coarse level observes the whole image at lower resolution and focuses on holistic reasoning. This provides context to an fine level which estimates highly detailed geometry by observing higher-resolution images. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques on single image human shape reconstruction by fully leveraging 1k-resolution input images."

Existing online methods restore color information per voxel, and thus their quality is often limited by the tradeoff between spatial resolution and time performance. Also, such methods often suffer from blurred artifacts in the captured texture. Traditional offline texture mapping methods with non-rigid warping assume that the reconstructed geometry and all input views are obtained in advance, and the optimization takes a long time to compute mesh parameterization and warp parameters, which prevents them from being used in real-time applications. In this work, we propose a progressive texture-fusion method specially designed for real-time RGB-D scanning. To this end, we first devise a novel texture-tile voxel grid, where texture tiles are embedded in the voxel grid of the signed distance function, allowing for high-resolution texture mapping on the low-resolution geometry volume. Instead of using expensive mesh parameterization, we associate vertices of implicit geometry directly with texture coordinates. Second, we introduce real-time texture warping that applies a spatially-varying perspective mapping to input images so that texture warping efficiently mitigates the mismatch between the intermediate geometry and the current input view. It allows us to enhance the quality of texture over time while updating the geometry in real-time. The results demonstrate that the quality of our real-time texture mapping is highly competitive to that of exhaustive offline texture warping methods. Our method is also capable of being integrated into existing RGB-D scanning frameworks."

Unfortunately, these approaches are currently restricted to voxel- and mesh-based representations, suffering from discretization or low resolution. In this work, we propose a differentiable rendering formulation for implicit shape and texture representations. Implicit representations have recently gained popularity as they represent shape and texture continuously. Our key insight is that depth gradients can be derived analytically using the concept of implicit differentiation. This allows us to learn implicit shape and texture representations directly from RGB images. We experimentally show that our single-view reconstructions rival those learned with full 3D supervision. Moreover, we find that our method can be used for multi-view 3D reconstruction, directly resulting in watertight meshes."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRzOtwBl7Eg,"Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) methods have attracted much attention and outperformed manually designed architectures on a few high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose HiNAS (Hierarchical NAS), an effort towards employing NAS to automatically design effective neural network architectures for image denoising. HiNAS adopts gradient based search strategies and employs operations with adaptive receptive field to build an flexible hierarchical search space. During the search stage, HiNAS shares cells across different feature levels to save memory and employ an early stopping strategy to avoid the collapse issue in NAS, and considerably accelerate the search speed. The proposed HiNAS is both memory and computation efficient, which takes only about 4.5 hours for searching using a single GPU. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed HiNAS on two different datasets, namely an additive white Gaussian noise dataset BSD500, and a realistic noise datasetSIM1800. Experimental results show that the architecture found by HiNAS has fewer parameters and enjoys a faster inference speed, while achieving highly competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. We also present analysis on the architectures found by NAS. HiNAS also shows good performance on experiments for image de-raining."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJiRQqDKbo,"The deep multi-view stereo (MVS) and stereo matching approaches generally construct 3D cost volumes to regularize and regress the output depth or disparity. These methods are limited when high-resolution outputs are needed since the memory and time costs grow cubically as the volume resolution increases. In this paper, we propose a both memory and time efficient cost volume formulation that is complementary to existing multi-view stereo and stereo matching approaches based on 3D cost volumes. First, the proposed cost volume is built upon a standard feature pyramid encoding geometry and context at gradually finer scales. Then, we can narrow the depth (or disparity) range of each stage by the depth (or disparity) map from the previous stage. With gradually higher cost volume resolution and adaptive adjustment of depth (or disparity) intervals, the output is recovered in a coarser to fine manner. We apply the cascade cost volume to the representative MVS-Net, and obtain a 35.6% improvement on DTU benchmark (1st place), with 50.6% and 59.3% reduction in GPU memory and run-time. It is also the state-of-the-art learning-based method on Tanks and Temples benchmark. The statistics of accuracy, run-time and GPU memory on other representative stereo CNNs also validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34c3Vf9g7kM,"Almost all previous deep learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) approaches focus on improving reconstruction quality. Besides quality, efficiency is also a desirable feature for MVS in real scenarios. Towards this end, this paper presents a Fast-MVSNet, a novel sparse-to-dense coarse-to-fine framework, for fast and accurate depth estimation in MVS. Specifically, in our Fast-MVSNet, we first construct a sparse cost volume for learning a sparse and high-resolution depth map. Then we leverage a small-scale convolutional neural network to encode the depth dependencies for pixels within a local region to densify the sparse high-resolution depth map. At last, a simple but efficient Gauss-Newton layer is proposed to further optimize the depth map. On one hand, the high-resolution depth map, the data-adaptive propagation method and the Gauss-Newton layer jointly guarantee the effectiveness of our method. On the other hand, all modules in our Fast-MVSNet are lightweight and thus guarantee the efficiency of our approach. Besides, our approach is also memory-friendly because of the sparse depth representation. Extensive experimental results show that our method is 5 times and 14 times faster than Point-MVSNet and R-MVSNet, respectively, while achieving comparable or even better results on the challenging Tanks and Temples dataset as well as the DTU dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/svip-lab/FastMVSNet."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJfklMtTWg,"Temporal action segmentation is a topic of increasing interest, however, annotating each frame in a video is cumbersome and costly. Weakly supervised approaches therefore aim at learning temporal action segmentation from videos that are only weakly labeled. In this work, we assume that for each training video only the list of actions is given that occur in the video, but not when, how often, and in which order they occur. In order to address this task, we propose an approach that can be trained end-to-end on such data. The approach divides the video into smaller temporal regions and predicts for each region the action label and its length. In addition, the network estimates the action labels for each frame. By measuring how consistent the frame-wise predictions are with respect to the temporal regions and the annotated action labels, the network learns to divide a video into class-consistent regions. We evaluate our approach on three datasets where the approach achieves state-of-the-art results."

The main challenge in this problem is the large individual variability inherited in human anatomy. Existing methods usually rely on the position information and the prior knowledge of the topology of the coronary artery tree, which may lead to unsatisfactory performance when the main branches are confusing. Motivated by the wide application of the graph neural network in structured data, in this paper, we propose a conditional partial-residual graph convolutional network (CPR-GCN), which takes both position and CT image into consideration, since CT image contains abundant information such as branch size and spanning direction. Two majority parts, a Partial-Residual GCN and a conditions extractor, are included in CPR-GCN. The conditions extractor is a hybrid model containing the 3D CNN and the LSTM, which can extract 3D spatial image features along the branches. On the technical side, the Partial-Residual GCN takes the position features of the branches, with the 3D spatial image features as conditions, to predict the label for each branches. While on the mathematical side, our approach twists the partial differential equation (PDE) into the graph modeling. A dataset with 511 subjects is collected from the clinic and annotated by two experts with a two-phase annotation process. According to the five-fold cross-validation, our CPR-GCN yields 95.8% meanRecall, 95.4% meanPrecision and 0.955 meanF1, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVYdCuSzIIo,"Automatically reasoning about future human behaviors is a difficult problem but has significant practical applications to assistive systems. Part of this difficulty stems from learning systems' inability to represent all kinds of behaviors. Some behaviors, such as motion, are best described with continuous representations, whereas others, such as picking up a cup, are best described with discrete representations. Furthermore, human behavior is generally not fixed: people can change their habits and routines. This suggests these systems must be able to learn and adapt continuously. In this work, we develop an efficient deep generative model to jointly forecast a person's future discrete actions and continuous motions. On a large-scale egocentric dataset, EPIC-KITCHENS, we observe our method generates high-quality and diverse samples while exhibiting better generalization than related generative models. Finally, we propose a variant to continually learn our model from streaming data, observe its practical effectiveness, and theoretically justify its learning efficiency."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqaDTRq28o8,"With rapid progress in high-throughput genotyping and neuroimaging, researches of complex brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), have gained significant attention in recent years. Many prediction models have been studied to relate neuroimaging measures to cognitive status over the progressions when these disease develops. Missing data is one of the biggest challenge in accurate cognitive score prediction of subjects in longitudinal neuroimaging studies. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a novel formulation to learn an enriched representation for imaging biomarkers that can simultaneously capture both the information conveyed by baseline neuroimaging records and that by progressive variations of varied counts of available follow-up records over time. While the numbers of the brain scans of the participants vary, the learned biomarker representation for every participant is a fixed-length vector, which enable us to use traditional learning models to study AD developments. Our new objective is formulated to maximize the ratio of the summations of a number of L1-norm distances for improved robustness, which, though, is difficult to efficiently solve in general. Thus we derive a new efficient iterative solution algorithm and rigorously prove its convergence. We have performed extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. A performance gain has been achieved to predict four different cognitive scores, when we compare the original baseline representations against the learned representations with enrichments. These promising empirical results have demonstrated improved performances of our new method that validate its effectiveness."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3KfwuUFdo,"The goal of the Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) task is to simultaneously predict a completed 3D voxel representation of volumetric occupancy and semantic labels of objects in the scene from a single-view observation. Since the computational cost generally increases explosively along with the growth of voxel resolution, most current state-of-the-arts have to tailor their framework into a low-resolution representation with the sacrifice of detail prediction. Thus, voxel resolution becomes one of the crucial difficulties that lead to the performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose to devise a new geometry-based strategy to embed depth information with low-resolution voxel representation, which could still be able to encode sufficient geometric information, e.g., room layout, object's sizes and shapes, to infer the invisible areas of the scene with well structure-preserving details. To this end, we first propose a novel 3D sketch-aware feature embedding to explicitly encode geometric information effectively and efficiently. With the 3D sketch in hand, we further devise a simple yet effective semantic scene completion framework that incorporates a light-weight 3D Sketch Hallucination module to guide the inference of occupancy and the semantic labels via a semi-supervised structure prior learning strategy. We demonstrate that our proposed geometric embedding works better than the depth feature learning from habitual SSC frameworks. Our final model surpasses state- of-the-arts consistently on three public benchmarks, which only requires 3D volumes of 60 x 36 x 60 resolution for both input and output."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCsuJbwd9zw,"Person images captured by unconstrained surveillance cameras often have low resolutions (LR). This causes the resolution mismatch problem when matched against the high-resolution (HR) gallery images, negatively affecting the performance of person re-identification (re-id). An effective approach is to leverage image super-resolution (SR) along with person re-id in a joint learning manner. However, this scheme is limited due to dramatically more difficult gradients backpropagation during training. In this paper, we introduce a novel model training regularisation method, called Inter-Task Association Critic (INTACT), to address this fundamental problem. Specifically, INTACT discovers the underlying association knowledge between image SR and person re-id, and leverages it as an extra learning constraint for enhancing the compatibility of SR model with person re-id in HR image space. This is realised by parameterising the association constraint which enables it to be automatically learned from the training data. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of INTACT over the state-of-the-art approaches on the cross-resolution re-id task using five standard person re-id datasets."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuoNHzsqOnM,"The difficulty of processing gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) in clinical microscopy has been a long-standing barrier to implementing computer aided diagnostic systems. Since modern computing resources are unable to perform computations at this extremely large scale, current state of the art methods utilize patch-based processing to preserve the resolution of WSIs. However, these methods are often resource intensive and make significant compromises on processing time. In this paper, we demonstrate that conventional patch-based processing is redundant for certain WSI classification tasks where high resolution is only required in a minority of cases. This reflects what is observed in clinical practice; where a pathologist may screen slides using a low power objective and only switch to a high power in cases where they are uncertain about their findings. To eliminate these redundancies, we propose a method for the selective use of high resolution processing based on the confidence of predictions on downscaled WSIs --- we call this the Selective Objective Switch (SOS). Our method is validated on a novel dataset of 684 Liver-Kidney-Stomach immunofluorescence WSIs routinely used in the investigation of autoimmune liver disease. By limiting high resolution processing to cases which cannot be classified confidently at low resolution, we maintain the accuracy of patch-level analysis whilst reducing the inference time by a factor of 7.74."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StZT8JnmrjY,"Video-based person re-identification (re-ID) is an important research topic in computer vision. The key to tackling the challenging task is to exploit both spatial and temporal clues in video sequences. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based framework, namely Multi-Granular Hypergraph (MGH), to pursue better representational capabilities by modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in terms of multiple granularities. Specifically, hypergraphs with different spatial granularities are constructed using various levels of part-based features across the video sequence. In each hypergraph, different temporal granularities are captured by hyperedges that connect a set of graph nodes (i.e., part-based features) across different temporal ranges. Two critical issues (misalignment and occlusion) are explicitly addressed by the proposed hypergraph propagation and feature aggregation schemes. Finally, we further enhance the overall video representation by learning more diversified graph-level representations of multiple granularities based on mutual information minimization. Extensive experiments on three widely-adopted benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, 90.0% top-1 accuracy on MARS is achieved using MGH, outperforming the state-of-the-arts."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnoPocpLEoo,"As humans, we inherently perceive images based on their predominant features, and ignore noise embedded within lower bit planes. On the contrary, Deep Neural Networks are known to confidently misclassify images corrupted with meticulously crafted perturbations that are nearly imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we attempt to address this problem by training networks to form coarse impressions based on the information in higher bit planes, and use the lower bit planes only to refine their prediction. We demonstrate that, by imposing consistency on the representations learned across differently quantized images, the adversarial robustness of networks improves significantly when compared to a normally trained model. Present state-of-the-art defenses against adversarial attacks require the networks to be explicitly trained using adversarial samples that are computationally expensive to generate. While such methods that use adversarial training continue to achieve the best results, this work paves the way towards achieving robustness without having to explicitly train on adversarial samples. The proposed approach is therefore faster, and also closer to the natural learning process in humans."

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) methods try to recover such hidden objects from their indirect reflections - faint signal components, traditionally treated as measurement noise. Existing NLOS approaches struggle to record these low-signal components outside the lab, and do not scale to large-scale outdoor scenes and high-speed motion, typical in automotive scenarios. In particular, optical NLOS capture is fundamentally limited by the quartic intensity falloff of diffuse indirect reflections. In this work, we depart from visible-wavelength approaches and demonstrate detection, classification, and tracking of hidden objects in large-scale dynamic environments using Doppler radars that can be manufactured at low-cost in series production. To untangle noisy indirect and direct reflections, we learn from temporal sequences of Doppler velocity and position measurements, which we fuse in a joint NLOS detection and tracking network over time. We validate the approach on in-the-wild automotive scenes, including sequences of parked cars or house facades as relay surfaces, and demonstrate low-cost, real-time NLOS in dynamic automotive environments."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GR_gMKqfuI,"In many real-world face restoration applications, e.g., smartphone photo albums and old films, multiple high-quality (HQ) images of the same person usually are available for a given degraded low-quality (LQ) observation. However, most existing guided face restoration methods are based on single HQ exemplar image, and are limited in properly exploiting guidance for improving the generalization ability to unknown degradation process. To address these issues, this paper suggests to enhance blind face restoration performance by utilizing multi-exemplar images and adaptive fusion of features from guidance and degraded images. First, given a degraded observation, we select the optimal guidance based on the weighted affine distance on landmark sets, where the landmark weights are learned to make the guidance image optimized to HQ image reconstruction. Second, moving least-square and adaptive instance normalization are leveraged for  spatial  alignment and illumination translation of guidance image in the feature space. Finally, for better feature fusion, multiple adaptive spatial feature fusion (ASFF) layers are introduced to incorporate guidance features in an adaptive and progressive manner, resulting in our ASFFNet. Experiments show that our ASFFNet performs favorably in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and is effective in generating photo-realistic results on real-world LQ images.

A deep recursive band network (DRBN) is proposed to recover a linear band representation of an enhanced normal-light image with paired low/normal-light images, and then obtain an improved one by recomposing the given bands via another learnable linear transformation based on a perceptual quality-driven adversarial learning with unpaired data. The architecture is powerful and flexible to have the merit of training with both paired and unpaired data. On one hand, the proposed network is well designed to extract a series of coarse-to-fine band representations, whose estimations are mutually beneficial in a recursive process. On the other hand, the extracted band representation of the enhanced image in the first stage of DRBN (recursive band learning) bridges the gap between the restoration knowledge of paired data and the perceptual quality preference to real high-quality images. Its second stage (band recomposition) learns to recompose the band representation towards fitting perceptual properties of high-quality images via adversarial learning. With the help of this two-stage design, our approach generates enhanced results with well-reconstructed details and visually promising contrast and color distributions. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our DRBN."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ulix8rfBhY,"Image-level weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims at learning semantic segmentation by adopting only image class labels. Existing approaches generally rely on class activation maps (CAM) to generate pseudo-masks and then train segmentation models. The main difficulty is that the CAM estimate only covers partial foreground objects. In this paper, we argue that the critical factor preventing to obtain the full object mask is the classification boundary mismatch problem in applying the CAM to WSSS. Because the CAM is optimized by the classification task, it focuses on the discrimination across different image-level classes. However, the WSSS requires to distinguish pixels sharing the same image-level class to separate them into the foreground and the background. To alleviate this contradiction, we propose an efficient end-to-end Intra-Class Discriminator (ICD) framework, which learns intra-class boundaries to help separate the foreground and the background within each image-level class. Without bells and whistles, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance of image label based WSSS, with mIoU 68.0% on the VOC 2012 semantic segmentation benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

We investigate the transferability of adversarial examples across a wide range of real-world computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, explicit content detection, and text detection. Our proposed attack minimizes the ""dispersion"" of the internal feature map, overcoming the limitations of existing attacks, that require task-specific loss functions and/or probing a target model.

Different from the existing works that mainly focus on identical or similar fashion item retrieval, in this paper, we aim to study the plagiarized clothes retrieval which is somewhat ignored in the academic community while itself has great application value. One of the key challenges is that plagiarized clothes are usually modified in a certain region on the original design to escape the supervision by traditional retrieval methods. To relieve it, we propose a novel network named Plagiarized-Search-Net (PS-Net) based on regional representation, where we utilize the landmarks to guide the learning of regional representations and compare fashion items region by region. Besides, we propose a new dataset named Plagiarized Fashion for plagiarized clothes retrieval, which provides a meaningful complement to the existing fashion retrieval field. Experiments on Plagiarized Fashion dataset verify that our approach is superior to other instance-level counterparts for plagiarized clothes retrieval, showing a promising result for original design protection.

Using only natural images, we show here that training a student model's input gradients to match those of a robust teacher model can gain robustness close to a strong baseline that is robustly trained from scratch. Through experiments in MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we show that our proposed method, input gradient adversarial matching, can transfer robustness across different tasks and even across different model architectures.

We introduce an end-to-end trainable architecture with three novel modules specifically designed for preserving feature spatial information and propagating feature matching information. The training is performed in a fully unsupervised fashion to optimize a matching metric. No ground truth transformation information nor category-level or instance-level matching supervision information is needed. After systematic assessments on six real and nine simulated datasets, we demonstrate that Gum-Net reduced the alignment error by 40 to 50% and improved the averaging resolution by 10%.

Meanwhile, problems in agriculture also pose new challenges in computer vision. For example, semantic segmentation of aerial farmland images requires inference over extremely large-size images with extreme annotation sparsity. These challenges are not present in most of the common object datasets, and we show that they are more challenging than many other aerial image datasets.

Second, by constructing a generative cleaning network with a feedback loop, we are able to generate an ensemble of diverse estimations of the original clean image. We then learn a network to fuse this set of diverse estimations together to restore the original image. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the state-of-art by large margins in both white-box and black-box attacks. It significantly improves the classification accuracy for white-box PGD attacks upon the second best method by more than 29% on the SVHN dataset and more than 39% on the challenging CIFAR-10 dataset."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvnINhYEsqU,"While video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) has drawn increasing attention and made great progress in recent years, it is still very challenging to effectively overcome the occlusion problem and the visual ambiguity problem for visually similar negative samples. On the other hand, we observe that different frames of a video can provide complementary information for each other, and the structural information of pedestrians can provide extra discriminative cues for appearance features. Thus, modeling the temporal relations of different frames and the spatial relations within a frame has the potential for solving the above problems. In this work, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) to solve these problems. The STGCN includes two GCN branches, a spatial one and a temporal one. The spatial branch extracts structural information of a human body. The temporal branch mines discriminative cues from adjacent frames. By jointly optimizing these branches, our model extracts robust spatial-temporal information that is complementary with appearance information. As shown in the experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art results on MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID datasets."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g-oXYMhz4M,"This paper studies model-inversion attacks, in which the access to a model is abused to infer information about the training data. Since its first introduction by [??], such attacks have raised serious concerns given that training data usually contain privacy sensitive information. Thus far, successful model-inversion attacks have only been demonstrated on simple models, such as linear regression and logistic regression. Previous attempts to invert neural networks, even the ones with simple architectures, have failed to produce convincing results. Here we present a novel attack method, termed the generative model-inversion attack, which can invert deep neural networks with high success rates. Rather than reconstructing private training data from scratch, we leverage partial public information, which can be very generic, to learn a distributional prior via generative adversarial networks (GANs) and use it to guide the inversion process. Moreover, we theoretically prove that a model's predictive power and its vulnerability to inversion attacks are indeed two sides of the same coin---highly predictive models are able to establish a strong correlation between features and labels, which coincides exactly with what an adversary exploits to mount the attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed attack improves identification accuracy over the existing work by about 75% for reconstructing face images from a state-of-the-art face recognition classifier. We also show that differential privacy, in its canonical form, is of little avail to defend against our attacks."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpOJ58RWb8,"We present Uncertainty-aware Cascaded Stereo Network (UCS-Net) for 3D reconstruction from multiple RGB images. Multi-view stereo (MVS) aims to reconstruct fine-grained scene geometry from multi-view images. Previous learning-based MVS methods estimate per-view depth using plane sweep volumes (PSVs) with a fixed depth hypothesis at each plane; this requires densely sampled planes for high accuracy, which is impractical for high-resolution depth because of limited memory. In contrast, we propose adaptive thin volumes (ATVs); in an ATV, the depth hypothesis of each plane is spatially varying, which adapts to the uncertainties of previous per-pixel depth predictions. Our UCS-Net has three stages: the first stage processes a small PSV to predict low-resolution depth; two ATVs are then used in the following stages to refine the depth with higher resolution and higher accuracy. Our ATV consists of only a small number of planes with low memory and computation costs; yet, it efficiently partitions local depth ranges within learned small uncertainty intervals. We propose to use variance-based uncertainty estimates to adaptively construct ATVs; this differentiable process leads to reasonable and fine-grained spatial partitioning. Our multi-stage framework progressively sub-divides the vast scene space with increasing depth resolution and precision, which enables reconstruction with high completeness and accuracy in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with other learning-based MVS methods on various challenging datasets."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2ydmicepd8,"In order to remove the non-uniform blur of images captured from dynamic scenes, many deep learning based methods design deep networks for large receptive fields and strong fitting capabilities, or use multi-scale strategy to deblur image on different scales gradually. Restricted by the fixed structures and parameters, these methods are always huge in model size to handle complex blurs. In this paper, we start from the deblurring deconvolution operation, then design an effective and real-time deblurring network. The main contributions are three folded, 1) we construct a spatially variant deconvolution network using modulated deformable convolutions, which can adjust receptive fields adaptively according to the blur features. 2) our analysis shows the sampling points of deformable convolution can be used to approximate the blur kernel, which can be simplified to bi-directional optical flows. So the position learning of sampling points can be supervised by bi-directional optical flows. 3) we build a light-weighted backbone for image restoration problem, which can balance the calculations and effectiveness well. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art deblurring performance, but with less parameters and shorter running time."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K8FyI7D2-A,"Motivated by the correlation between the depth and the geometric structure of a 360 indoor image, we propose a novel learning-based depth estimation framework that leverages the geometric structure of a scene to conduct depth estimation. Specifically, we represent the geometric structure of an indoor scene as a collection of corners, boundaries and planes. On the one hand, once a depth map is estimated, this geometric structure can be inferred from the estimated depth map; thus, the geometric structure functions as a regularizer for depth estimation. On the other hand, this estimation also benefits from the geometric structure of a scene estimated from an image where the structure functions as a prior. However, furniture in indoor scenes makes it challenging to infer geometric structure from depth or image data. An attention map is inferred to facilitate both depth estimation from features of the geometric structure and also geometric inferences from the estimated depth map. To validate the effectiveness of each component in our framework under controlled conditions, we render a synthetic dataset, Shanghaitech-Kujiale Indoor 360 dataset with 3550 360 indoor images. Extensive experiments on popular datasets validate the effectiveness of our solution. We also demonstrate that our method can also be applied to counterfactual depth."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMqI6vrPB-4,"This paper tackles the problem of motion deblurring of dynamic scenes. Although end-to-end fully convolutional designs have recently advanced the state-of-the-art in non-uniform motion deblurring, their performance-complexity trade-off is still sub-optimal. Existing approaches achieve a large receptive field by increasing the number of generic convolution layers and kernel-size, but this comesat the expense of of the increase in model size and inference speed. In this work, we propose an efficient pixel adaptive and feature attentive design for handling large blur variations across different spatial locations and process each test image adaptively. We also propose an effective content-aware global-local filtering module that significantly improves performance by considering not only global dependencies but also by dynamically exploiting neighboring pixel information. We use a patch-hierarchical attentive architecture composed of the above module that implicitly discovers the spatial variations in the blur present in the input image and in turn, performs local and global modulation of intermediate features. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons with prior art on deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our design offers significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in accuracy as well as speed."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKcMD-4JQAg,"Reconstruction of a 3D shape from a single 2D image is a classical computer vision problem, whose difficulty stems from the inherent ambiguity of recovering occluded or only partially observed surfaces. Recent methods address this challenge through the use of largely unstructured neural networks that effectively distill conditional mapping and priors over 3D shape. In this work, we induce structure and geometric constraints by leveraging three core observations: (1) the surface of most everyday objects is often almost entirely exposed from pairs of typical opposite views; (2) everyday objects often exhibit global reflective symmetries which can be accurately predicted from single views; (3) opposite orthographic views of a 3D shape share consistent silhouettes. Following these observations, we first predict orthographic 2.5D visible surface maps (depth, normal and silhouette) from perspective 2D images, and detect global reflective symmetries in this data; second, we predict the back facing depth and normal maps using as input the front maps and, when available, the symmetric reflections of these maps; and finally, we reconstruct a 3D mesh from the union of these maps using a surface reconstruction method best suited for this data. Our experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the art approaches for 3D shape reconstructions from 2D and 2.5D data in terms of input fidelity and details preservation. Specifically, we achieve 12% better performance on average in ShapeNet benchmark dataset, and up to 19% for certain classes of objects (e.g., chairs and vessels)."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7ZDA3lJaJM,"In this paper, we address the problem of rain streaks removal in video by developing a self-learned rain streak removal method, which does not require any clean groundtruth images in the training process. The method is inspired by fact that the adjacent frames are highly correlated and can be regarded as different versions of identical scene, and rain streaks are randomly distributed along the temporal dimension. With this in mind, we construct a two-stage Self-Learned Deraining Network (SLDNet) to remove rain streaks based on both temporal correlation and consistency. In the first stage, SLDNet utilizes the temporal correlations and learns to predict the clean version of the current frame based on its adjacent rain video frames. In the second stage, SLDNet enforces the temporal consistency among different frames. It takes both the current rain frame and adjacent rain video frames to recover structural details. The first stage is responsible for reconstructing main structures, and the second stage is responsible for extracting structural details. We build our network architecture with two sub-tasks, i.e. motion estimation, and rain region detection, and optimize them jointly. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, offering better results both quantitatively and qualitatively."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbJseAnyivY,"Reconstructing 3D models from 2D images is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision. In this work, we propose a deep learning technique for 3D object reconstruction from a single image. Contrary to recent works that either use 3D supervision or multi-view supervision, we use only single view images with no pose information during training as well. This makes our approach more practical requiring only an image collection of an object category and the corresponding silhouettes. We learn both 3D point cloud reconstruction and pose estimation networks in a self-supervised manner, making use of differentiable point cloud renderer to train with 2D supervision. A key novelty of the proposed technique is to impose 3D geometric reasoning into predicted 3D point clouds by rotating them with randomly sampled poses and then enforcing cycle consistency on both 3D reconstructions and poses. In addition, using single-view supervision allows us to do test-time optimization on a given test image. Experiments on the synthetic ShapeNet and real-world Pix3D datasets demonstrate that our approach, despite using less supervision, can achieve competitive performance compared to pose-supervised and multi-view supervised approaches."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2GKJh4zbA,"Human gaze behavior prediction is important for behavioral vision and for computer vision applications. Most models mainly focus on predicting free-viewing behavior using saliency maps, but do not generalize to goal-directed behavior, such as when a person searches for a visual target object. We propose the first inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) model to learn the internal reward function and policy used by humans during visual search. We modeled the viewer's internal belief states as dynamic contextual belief maps of object locations. These maps were learned and then used to predict behavioral scanpaths for multiple target categories. To train and evaluate our IRL model we created COCO-Search18, which is now the largest dataset of high-quality search fixations in existence. COCO-Search18 has 10 participants searching for each of 18 target-object categories in 6202 images, making about 300,000 goal-directed fixations. When trained and evaluated on COCO-Search18, the IRL model outperformed baseline models in predicting search fixation scanpaths, both in terms of similarity to human search behavior and search efficiency. Finally, reward maps recovered by the IRL model reveal distinctive target-dependent patterns of object prioritization, which we interpret as a learned object context."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckfou0UKAQA,"Many real-world applications in augmented reality (AR), 3D mapping, and robotics require both fast and accurate estimation of camera poses and scales from multiple images captured by multiple cameras or a single moving camera. Achieving high speed and maintaining high accuracy in a pose-and-scale estimator are often conflicting goals. To simultaneously achieve both, we exploit a priori knowledge about the solution space. We present gDLS*, a generalized-camera-model pose-and-scale estimator that utilizes rotation and scale priors. gDLS* allows an application to flexibly weigh the contribution of each prior, which is important since priors often come from noisy sensors. Compared to state-of-the-art generalized-pose-and-scale estimators (e.g., gDLS), our experiments on both synthetic and real data consistently demonstrate that gDLS* accelerates the estimation process and improves scale and pose accuracy."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qwWzuFDcsA,"Recent advances in adversarial attacks uncover the intrinsic vulnerability of modern deep neural networks. Since then, extensive efforts have been devoted to enhancing the robustness of deep networks via specialized learning algorithms and loss functions. In this work, we take an architectural perspective and investigate the patterns of network architectures that are resilient to adversarial attacks. To obtain the large number of networks needed for this study, we adopt one-shot neural architecture search, training a large network for once and then finetuning the sub-networks sampled therefrom. The sampled architectures together with the accuracies they achieve provide a rich basis for our study. Our ""robust architecture Odyssey"" reveals several valuable observations: 1) densely connected patterns result in improved robustness; 2) under computational budget, adding convolution operations to direct connection edge is effective; 3) flow of solution procedure (FSP) matrix is a good indicator of network robustness. Based on these observations, we discover a family of robust architectures (RobNets). On various datasets, including CIFAR, SVHN, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet, RobNets exhibit superior robustness performance to other widely used architectures. Notably, RobNets substantially improve the robust accuracy ( 5% absolute gains) under both white-box and black-box attacks, even with fewer parameter numbers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9xXZFsph5w,"Diffeomorphic deformable image registration is crucial in many medical image studies, as it offers unique, special features including topology preservation and invertibility of the transformation. Recent deep learning-based deformable image registration methods achieve fast image registration by leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the spatial transformation from the synthetic ground truth or the similarity metric. However, these approaches often ignore the topology preservation of the transformation and the smoothness of the transformation which is enforced by a global smoothing energy function alone. Moreover, deep learning-based approaches often estimate the displacement field directly, which cannot guarantee the existence of the inverse transformation. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient unsupervised symmetric image registration method which maximizes the similarity between images within the space of diffeomorphic maps and estimates both forward and inverse transformations simultaneously. We evaluate our method on 3D image registration with a large scale brain image dataset. Our method achieves state-of-the-art registration accuracy and running time while maintaining desirable diffeomorphic properties."

In this paper, we propose 3D Graph Convolution Networks (3D-GCN), which is designed to extract local 3D features from point clouds across scales, while shift and scale-invariance properties are introduced. The novelty of our 3D-GCN lies in the definition of learnable kernels with a graph max-pooling mechanism.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptwGoq0C1RM,"Graph convolution networks (GCN) are increasingly popular in many applications, yet remain notoriously hard to train over large graph datasets. They need to compute node representations recursively from their neighbors. Current GCN training algorithms suffer from either high computational costs that grow exponentially with the number of layers, or high memory usage for loading the entire graph and node embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient layer-wise training framework for GCN (L-GCN), that disentangles feature aggregation and feature transformation during training, hence greatly reducing time and memory complexities. We present theoretical analysis for L-GCN under the graph isomorphism framework, that L-GCN leads to as powerful GCNs as the more costly conventional training algorithm does, under mild conditions. We further propose L^2-GCN, which learns a controller for each layer that can automatically adjust the training epochs per layer in L-GCN. Experiments show that L-GCN is faster than state-of-the-arts by at least an order of magnitude, with a consistent of memory usage not dependent on dataset size, while maintaining comparable prediction performance. With the learned controller, L^2-GCN can further cut the training time in half. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/L2-GCN."

We call this approach Orientation Regularized Network (ORN). Then we lift the multi-view 2D poses to the 3D space by an Orientation Regularized Pictorial Structure Model (ORPSM) which jointly minimizes the projection error between the 3D and 2D poses, along with the discrepancy between the 3D pose and IMU orientations. The simple two-step approach reduces the error of the state-of-the-art by a large margin on a public dataset.

We leverage defocus cues by using a permutation invariant convolutional neural network that encourages the network to learn from the differences between images with a different point of focus. Our proposed network uses the defocus map as an intermediate supervisory signal. We are able to train our model completely on synthetic data and directly apply it to a wide range of real-world images.

The information from cross views (i.e., mediolateral oblique and cranio-caudal) is highly related and complementary, and is helpful to make comprehensive decisions. However, unlike radiologists who are able to recognize masses with reasoning ability in cross-view images, most existing methods lack the ability to reason under the guidance of domain knowledge, thus it limits the performance. In this paper, we introduce bipartite graph convolutional network to endow existing methods with cross-view reasoning ability of radiologists in mammogram mass detection. The bipartite node sets are constructed by cross-view images respectively to represent relatively consistent regions in breasts, while the bipartite edge learns to model both inherent cross-view geometric constraints and appearance similarities between correspondences. Based on the bipartite graph, the information propagates methodically through correspondences and enables spatial visual features equipped with customized cross-view reasoning ability. Experimental results on DDSM dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance. Besides, visual analysis shows the model has a clear physical meaning, which is helpful for radiologists in clinical interpretation."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuX3BpZvlA,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown promising performance in image synthesis and unsupervised learning (USL). In most cases, however, the representations extracted from unsupervised GAN are usually unsatisfactory in other computer vision tasks. By using conditional GAN (CGAN), this problem could be solved to some extent, but the main drawback of such models is the necessity for labeled data. To improve both image synthesis quality and representation learning performance under the unsupervised setting, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Transformation Generative Adversarial Networks (TrGAN). In our approach, instead of capturing the joint distribution of image-label pairs p(x,y) as in conditional GAN, we try to estimate the joint distribution of transformed image t(x) and transformation t. Specifically, given a randomly sampled transformation t, we train the discriminator to give an estimate of input transformation, while following the adversarial training scheme of the original GAN. In addition, intermediate feature matching as well as feature-transform matching methods are introduced to strengthen the regularization on the generated features. To evaluate the quality of both generated samples and extracted representations, extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets. The experimental results on the quality of both the synthesized images and the extracted representations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poaZO5N1J18,"This paper considers learning deep features from long-tailed data. We observe that in the deep feature space, the head classes and the tail classes present different distribution patterns. The head classes have a relatively large spatial span, while the tail classes have a significantly small spatial span, due to the lack of intra-class diversity. This uneven distribution between head and tail classes distorts the overall feature space, which compromises the discriminative ability of the learned features. In response, we seek to expand the distribution of the tail classes during training, so as to alleviate the distortion of the feature space. To this end, we propose to augment each instance of the tail classes with certain disturbances in the deep feature space. With the augmentation, a specified feature vector becomes a set of probable features scattered around itself, which is analogical to an atomic nucleus surrounded by the electron cloud. Intuitively, we name it as ""feature cloud"". The intra-class distribution of the feature cloud is learned from the head classes, and thus provides higher intra-class variation to the tail classes. Consequentially, it alleviates the distortion of the learned feature space, and improves deep representation learning on long tailed data. Extensive experimental evaluations on person re-identification and face recognition tasks confirm the effectiveness of our method."

We formulate the recovery of the two quantities as a vector deconvolution problem, and solve it via Cholesky-Wiener decomposition. We demonstrate that surfaces fitted non-parametrically using our recovered normals are more accurate than those produced with NLOS surface reconstruction methods recently proposed, and are 1,000 times faster to compute than using inverse rendering."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vPr8RTAauI,"Convolutional neural network-based approaches have achieved remarkable progress in semantic segmentation. However, these approaches heavily rely on annotated data which are labor intensive. To cope with this limitation, automatically annotated data generated from graphic engines are used to train segmentation models. However, the models trained from synthetic data are difficult to transfer to real images. To tackle this issue, previous works have considered directly adapting models from the source data to the unlabeled target data (to reduce the inter-domain gap). Nonetheless, these techniques do not consider the large distribution gap among the target data itself (intra-domain gap). In this work, we propose a two-step self-supervised domain adaptation approach to minimize the inter-domain and intra-domain gap together. First, we conduct the inter-domain adaptation of the model, from this adaptation, we separate target domain into an easy and hard split using an entropy-based ranking function. Finally, to decrease the intra-domain gap, we propose to employ a self-supervised adaptation technique from the easy to the hard subdomain.

Inspired by the frequency band decomposition characteristic of Human Vision System (HVS), we propose a video prediction network based on multi-level wavelet analysis to uniformly deal with spatial and temporal information. Specifically, multi-level spatial discrete wavelet transform decomposes each video frame into anisotropic sub-bands with multiple frequencies, helping to enrich structural information and reserve fine details. On the other hand, multilevel temporal discrete wavelet transform which operates on time axis decomposes the frame sequence into sub-band groups of different frequencies to accurately capture multifrequency motions under a fixed frame rate.

Building upon a light-weight optical flow estimation network to obtain depth maps, our method employs two reconstruction modules in pixel and feature domains respectively. For the pixel-wise reconstruction, occlusions are explicitly handled by a disparity-dependent interpolation filter, whereas inpainting on disoccluded areas is learned by convolutional layers. Due to disparity inconsistencies, the pixel-based reconstruction may lead to blurriness in highly textured areas as well as on object contours. On the contrary, the feature-based reconstruction well performs on high frequencies, making the reconstruction in the two domains complementary. End-to-end learning is finally performed including a fusion module merging pixel and feature-based reconstructions. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, moreover, it is even able to extend light fields' baseline by extrapolating high quality views without additional training."

Existing methods usually utilize pre-defined pruning criteria, such as Lp-norm, to prune unimportant filters. There are two major limitations to these methods. First, existing methods fail to consider the variety of filter distribution across layers. To extract features of the coarse level to the fine level, the filters of different layers have various distributions. Therefore, it is not suitable to utilize the same pruning criteria to different functional layers. Second, prevailing layer-by-layer pruning methods process each layer independently and sequentially, failing to consider that all the layers in the network collaboratively make the final prediction. In this paper, we propose Learning Filter Pruning Criteria (LFPC) to solve the above problems. Specifically, we develop a differentiable pruning criteria sampler. This sampler is learnable and optimized by the validation loss of the pruned network obtained from the sampled criteria. In this way, we could adaptively select the appropriate pruning criteria for different functional layers. Besides, when evaluating the sampled criteria, LFPC comprehensively consider the contribution of all the layers at the same time. Experiments validate our approach on three image classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our LFPC reduces more than 60% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.83% top-5 accuracy loss."

One difficulty arises from the high cost associated with annotating tumor regions in WSIs. Furthermore, both global and local image features must be extracted from the WSI by changing the magnifications of the image. In addition, the image features should be stably detected against the differences of staining conditions among the hospitals/specimens. In this paper, we develop a new CNN-based cancer subtype classification method by effectively combining multiple-instance, domain adversarial, and multi-scale learning frameworks in order to overcome these practical difficulties. When the proposed method was applied to malignant lymphoma subtype classifications of 196 cases collected from multiple hospitals, the classification performance was significantly better than the standard CNN or other conventional methods, and the accuracy compared favorably with that of standard pathologists."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCBYhdCPpoA,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS), aiming at automatically designing network architectures by machines, is expected to bring about a new revolution in machine learning. Despite these high expectation, the effectiveness and efficiency of existing NAS solutions are unclear, with some recent works going so far as to suggest that many existing NAS solutions are no better than random architecture selection. The ineffectiveness of NAS solutions may be attributed to inaccurate architecture evaluation. Specifically, to speed up NAS, recent works have proposed under-training different candidate architectures in a large search space concurrently by using shared network parameters; however, this has resulted in incorrect architecture ratings and furthered the ineffectiveness of NAS. In this work, we propose to modularize the large search space of NAS into blocks to ensure that the potential candidate architectures are fully trained; this reduces the representation shift caused by the shared parameters and leads to the correct rating of the candidates. Thanks to the block-wise search, we can also evaluate all of the candidate architectures within each block. Moreover, we find that the knowledge of a network model lies not only in the network parameters but also in the network architecture. Therefore, we propose to distill the neural architecture (DNA) knowledge from a teacher model to supervise our block-wise architecture search, which significantly improves the effectiveness of NAS. Remarkably, the performance of our searched architectures has exceeded the teacher model, demonstrating the practicability of our method. Finally, our method achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in a mobile setting. All of our searched models along with the evaluation code are available at https://github.com/changlin31/DNA."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWbHimeNtQA,"Recently, deep neural networks are introduced as supervised discriminative models for the learning of 3D point cloud segmentation. Most previous supervised methods require a large number of training data with human annotation part labels to guide the training process to ensure the model's generalization abilities on test data. In comparison, we propose a novel 3D shape segmentation method that requires few labeled data for training. Given an input 3D shape, the training of our model starts with identifying a similar 3D shape with part annotations from a mini-pool of shape templates (e.g. 10 shapes). With the selected template shape, a novel Coherent Point Transformer is proposed to fully leverage the power of a deep neural network to smoothly morph the template shape towards the input shape. Then, based on the transformed template shapes with part labels, a newly proposed Part-specific Density Estimator is developed to learn a continuous part-specific probability distribution function on the entire 3D space with a batch consistency regularization term. With the learned part-specific probability distribution, our model is able to predict the part labels of a new input 3D shape in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve remarkable segmentation results on the ShapeNet dataset with few shots, compared to previous supervised learning approaches."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hugV0OBxrP0,"Humans learn to drive through both practice and theory, e.g. by studying the rules, while most self-driving systems are limited to the former. Being able to incorporate human knowledge of typical causal driving behaviour should benefit autonomous systems. We propose a new approach that learns vehicle control with the help of human advice. Specifically, our system learns to summarize its visual observations in natural language, predict an appropriate action response (e.g. ""I see a pedestrian crossing, so I stop""), and predict the controls, accordingly. Moreover, to enhance interpretability of our system, we introduce a fine-grained attention mechanism which relies on semantic segmentation and object-centric RoI pooling. We show that our approach of training the autonomous system with human advice, grounded in a rich semantic representation, matches or outperforms prior work in terms of control prediction and explanation generation. Our approach also results in more interpretable visual explanations by visualizing object-centric attention maps. Code is available at https://github.com/JinkyuKimUCB/advisable-driving."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCxX72izBdA,"We present a lightweight solution to recover 3D pose from multi-view images captured with spatially calibrated cameras. Building upon recent advances in interpretable representation learning, we exploit 3D geometry to fuse input images into a unified latent representation of pose, which is disentangled from camera view-points. This allows us to reason effectively about 3D pose across different views without using compute-intensive volumetric grids. Our architecture then conditions the learned representation on camera projection operators to produce accurate per-view 2d detections, that can be simply lifted to 3D via a differentiable Direct Linear Transform (DLT) layer. In order to do it efficiently, we propose a novel implementation of DLT that is orders of magnitude faster on GPU architectures than standard SVD-based triangulation methods. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale human pose datasets (H36M and Total Capture): our method outperforms or performs comparably to the state-of-the-art volumetric methods, while, unlike them, yielding real-time performance."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJClIX11UYc,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations applied to the input. These adversarial perturbations, though imperceptible, can easily mislead the DNN. In this work, we take a control theoretic approach to the problem of robustness in DNNs. We treat each individual layer of the DNN as a nonlinear system and use Lyapunov theory to prove stability and robustness locally. We then proceed to prove stability and robustness globally for the entire DNN. We develop empirically tight bounds on the response of the output layer, or any hidden layer, to adversarial perturbations added to the input, or the input of hidden layers. Recent works have proposed spectral norm regularization as a solution for improving robustness against l2 adversarial attacks. Our results give new insights into how spectral norm regularization can mitigate the adversarial effects. Finally, we evaluate the power of our approach on a variety of data sets and network architectures and against some of the well-known adversarial attacks."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSqBsLAZS0U,"Recovering the 3D shape of a person from its 2D appearance is ill-posed due to ambiguities. Nevertheless, with the help of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and prior knowledge on the 3D human body, it is possible to overcome such ambiguities to recover detailed 3D shapes of human bodies from single images. Current solutions, however, fail to reconstruct all the details of a person wearing loose clothes. This is because of either (a) huge memory requirement that cannot be maintained even on modern GPUs or (b) the compact 3D representation that cannot encode all the details. In this paper, we propose the tetrahedral outer shell volumetric truncated signed distance function (TetraTSDF) model for the human body, and its corresponding part connection network (PCN) for 3D human body shape regression. Our proposed model is compact, dense, accurate, and yet well suited for CNN-based regression task. Our proposed PCN allows us to learn the distribution of the TSDF in the tetrahedral volume from a single image in an end-to-end manner. Results show that our proposed method allows to reconstruct detailed shapes of humans wearing loose clothes from single RGB images."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O7qEJKhrws,"In this paper, we propose a unified method to jointly learn optical flow and stereo matching. Our first intuition is stereo matching can be modeled as a special case of optical flow, and we can leverage 3D geometry behind stereoscopic videos to guide the learning of these two forms of correspondences. We then enroll this knowledge into the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning framework, and train one single network to estimate both flow and stereo. Second, we unveil the bottlenecks in prior self-supervised learning approaches, and propose to create a new set of challenging proxy tasks to boost performance. These two insights yield a single model that achieves the highest accuracy among all existing unsupervised flow and stereo methods on KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks. More remarkably, our self-supervised method even outperforms several state-of-the-art fully supervised methods, including PWC-Net and FlowNet2 on KITTI 2012."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdE4M98Txpo,"In this paper, we address the task of semantic-guided scene generation. One open challenge widely observed in global image-level generation methods is the difficulty of generating small objects and detailed local texture. To tackle this issue, in this work we consider learning the scene generation in a local context, and correspondingly design a local class-specific generative network with semantic maps as a guidance, which separately constructs and learns sub-generators concentrating on the generation of different classes, and is able to provide more scene details. To learn more discriminative class-specific feature representations for the local generation, a novel classification module is also proposed. To combine the advantage of both global image-level and the local class-specific generation, a joint generation network is designed with an attention fusion module and a dual-discriminator structure embedded. Extensive experiments on two scene image generation tasks show superior generation performance of the proposed model. State-of-the-art results are established by large margins on both tasks and on challenging public benchmarks. The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/LGGAN."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5u4q9IQzZg,"In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks have achieved impressive results in photorealistic image synthesis. This progress nurtures hopes that one day the classical rendering pipeline can be replaced by efficient models that are learned directly from images. However, current image synthesis models operate in the 2D domain where disentangling 3D properties such as camera viewpoint or object pose is challenging. Furthermore, they lack an interpretable and controllable representation. Our key hypothesis is that the image generation process should be modeled in 3D space as the physical world surrounding us is intrinsically three-dimensional. We define the new task of 3D controllable image synthesis and propose an approach for solving it by reasoning both in 3D space and in the 2D image domain. We demonstrate that our model is able to disentangle latent 3D factors of simple multi-object scenes in an unsupervised fashion from raw images. Compared to pure 2D baselines, it allows for synthesizing scenes that are consistent wrt. changes in viewpoint or object pose. We further evaluate various 3D representations in terms of their usefulness for this challenging task."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R7wBjVGXqw,"Neural networks have greatly boosted performance in computer vision by learning powerful representations of input data. The drawback of end-to-end training for maximal overall performance are black-box models whose hidden representations are lacking interpretability: Since distributed coding is optimal for latent layers to improve their robustness, attributing meaning to parts of a hidden feature vector or to individual neurons is hindered. We formulate interpretation as a translation of hidden representations onto semantic concepts that are comprehensible to the user. The mapping between both domains has to be bijective so that semantic modifications in the target domain correctly alter the original representation. The proposed invertible interpretation network can be transparently applied on top of existing architectures with no need to modify or retrain them. Consequently, we translate an original representation to an equivalent yet interpretable one and backwards without affecting the expressiveness and performance of the original. The invertible interpretation network disentangles the hidden representation into separate, semantically meaningful concepts. Moreover, we present an efficient approach to define semantic concepts by only sketching two images and also an unsupervised strategy. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the wide applicability to interpretation of existing classification and image generation networks as well as to semantically guided image manipulation."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFhNBTUkxvY,"3D hand shape and pose estimation from a single depth map is a new and challenging computer vision problem with many applications. The state-of-the-art methods directly regress 3D hand meshes from 2D depth images via 2D convolutional neural networks, which leads to artefacts in the estimations due to perspective distortions in the images. In contrast, we propose a novel architecture with 3D convolutions trained in a weakly-supervised manner. The input to our method is a 3D voxelized depth map, and we rely on two hand shape representations. The first one is the 3D voxelized grid of the shape which is accurate but does not preserve the mesh topology and the number of mesh vertices. The second representation is the 3D hand surface which is less accurate but does not suffer from the limitations of the first representation. We combine the advantages of these two representations by registering the hand surface to the voxelized hand shape. In the extensive experiments, the proposed approach improves over the state of the art by47.8% on the SynHand5M dataset. Moreover, our augmentation policy for voxelized depth maps further enhances the accuracy of 3D hand pose estimation on real data. Our method produces visually more reasonable and realistic hand shapes on NYU and BigHand2.2M datasets compared to the existing approaches."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJSwkTiUlvs,"Existing state-of-the-art RGB-D salient object detection methods explore RGB-D data relying on a two-stream architecture, in which an independent subnetwork is required to process depth data. This inevitably incurs extra computational costs and memory consumption, and using depth data during testing may hinder the practical applications of RGB-D saliency detection. To tackle these two dilemmas, we propose a depth distiller (A2dele) to explore the way of using network prediction and attention as two bridges to transfer the depth knowledge from the depth stream to the RGB stream. First, by adaptively minimizing the differences between predictions generated from the depth stream and RGB stream, we realize the desired control of pixel-wise depth knowledge transferred to the RGB stream. Second, to transfer the localization knowledge to RGB features, we encourage consistencies between the dilated prediction of the depth stream and the attention map from the RGB stream. As a result, we achieve a lightweight architecture without use of depth data at test time by embedding our A2dele. Our extensive experimental evaluation on five benchmarks demonstrate that our RGB stream achieves state-of-the-art performance, which tremendously minimizes the model size by 76% and runs 12 times faster, compared with the best performing method. Furthermore, our A2dele can be applied to existing RGB-D networks to significantly improve their efficiency while maintaining performance (boosts FPS by nearly twice for DMRA and 3 times for CPFP)."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5D0C7nAB7k,"Object frequency in the real world often follows a power law, leading to a mismatch between datasets with long-tailed class distributions seen by a machine learning model and our expectation of the model to perform well on all classes. We analyze this mismatch from a domain adaptation point of view. First of all, we connect existing class-balanced methods for long-tailed classification to target shift, a well-studied scenario in domain adaptation. The connection reveals that these methods implicitly assume that the training data and test data share the same class-conditioned distribution, which does not hold in general and especially for the tail classes. While a head class could contain abundant and diverse training examples that well represent the expected data at inference time, the tail classes are often short of representative training data. To this end, we propose to augment the classic class-balanced learning by explicitly estimating the differences between the class-conditioned distributions with a meta-learning approach. We validate our approach with six benchmark datasets and three loss functions."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3Fllxv1VRY,"Deep neural networks have exhibited promising performance in image super-resolution (SR) by learning a nonlinear mapping function from low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. However, there are two underlying limitations to existing SR methods. First, learning the mapping function from LR to HR images is typically an ill-posed problem, because there exist infinite HR images that can be downsampled to the same LR image. As a result, the space of the possible functions can be extremely large, which makes it hard to find a good solution. Second, the paired LR-HR data may be unavailable in real-world applications and the underlying degradation method is often unknown. For such a more general case, existing SR models often incur the adaptation problem and yield poor performance. To address the above issues, we propose a dual regression scheme by introducing an additional constraint on LR data to reduce the space of the possible functions. Specifically, besides the mapping from LR to HR images, we learn an additional dual regression mapping estimates the down-sampling kernel and reconstruct LR images, which forms a closed-loop to provide additional supervision. More critically, since the dual regression process does not depend on HR images, we can directly learn from LR images. In this sense, we can easily adapt SR models to real-world data, e.g., raw video frames from YouTube. Extensive experiments with paired training data and unpaired real-world data demonstrate our superiority over existing methods."

Our method performs automated semantic image manipulations and tests for consistency in model predictions to quantify the model robustness as well as generate synthetic data to counter these problems. We perform our analysis on three diverse, state of the art VQA models and diverse question types with a particular focus on challenging counting questions. In addition, we show that models can be made significantly more robust against inconsistent predictions using our edited data. Finally, we show that results also translate to real-world error cases of state of the art models, which results in improved overall performance"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEnxOLUI3iM,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is to make predictions for unlabeled data on a target domain, given labeled data on a source domain whose distribution shifts from the target one. Mainstream UDA methods learn aligned features between the two domains, such that a classifier trained on the source features can be readily applied to the target ones. However, such a transferring strategy has a potential risk of damaging the intrinsic discrimination of target data. To alleviate this risk, we are motivated by the assumption of structural domain similarity, and propose to directly uncover the intrinsic target discrimination via discriminative clustering of target data. We constrain the clustering solutions using structural source regularization that hinges on our assumed structural domain similarity. Technically, we use a flexible framework of deep network based discriminative clustering that minimizes the KL divergence between predictive label distribution of the network and an introduced auxiliary one; replacing the auxiliary distribution with that formed by ground-truth labels of source data implements the structural source regularization via a simple strategy of joint network training. We term our proposed method as Structurally Regularized Deep Clustering (SRDC), where we also enhance target discrimination with clustering of intermediate network features, and enhance structural regularization with soft selection of less divergent source examples. Careful ablation studies show the efficacy of our proposed SRDC. Notably, with no explicit domain alignment, SRDC outperforms all existing methods on three UDA benchmarks."

Inspired by the success of compositional models at classifying partially occluded objects, we propose to integrate compositional models and DCNNs into a unified deep model with innate robustness to partial occlusion. We term this architecture Compositional Convolutional Neural Network. In particular, we propose to replace the fully connected classification head of a DCNN with a differentiable compositional model. The generative nature of the compositional model enables it to localize occluders and subsequently focus on the non-occluded parts of the object. We conduct classification experiments on artificially occluded images as well as real images of partially occluded objects from the MS-COCO dataset. The results show that DCNNs do not classify occluded objects robustly, even when trained with data that is strongly augmented with partial occlusions. Our proposed model outperforms standard DCNNs by a large margin at classifying partially occluded objects, even when it has not been exposed to occluded objects during training. Additional experiments demonstrate that CompositionalNets can also localize the occluders accurately, despite being trained with class labels only.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH2gmtRW7HU,"We present a deep learning solution for estimating the incident illumination at any 3D location within a scene from an input narrow-baseline stereo image pair. Previous approaches for predicting global illumination from images either predict just a single illumination for the entire scene, or separately estimate the illumination at each 3D location without enforcing that the predictions are consistent with the same 3D scene. Instead, we propose a deep learning model that estimates a 3D volumetric RGBA model of a scene, including content outside the observed field of view, and then uses standard volume rendering to estimate the incident illumination at any 3D location within that volume. Our model is trained without any ground truth 3D data and only requires a held-out perspective view near the input stereo pair and a spherical panorama taken within each scene as supervision, as opposed to prior methods for spatially-varying lighting estimation, which require ground truth scene geometry for training. We demonstrate that our method can predict consistent spatially-varying lighting that is convincing enough to plausibly relight and insert highly specular virtual objects into real images."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7UeDzk1DKo,"Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to localize object with only weak supervision like image-level labels. However, a long-standing problem for available techniques based on the classification network is that they often result in highlighting the most discriminative parts rather than the entire extent of object. Nevertheless, trying to explore the integral extent of the object could degrade the performance of image classification on the contrary. To remedy this, we propose a simple yet powerful approach by introducing a novel adversarial erasing technique, erasing integrated learning (EIL). By integrating discriminative region mining and adversarial erasing in a single forward-backward propagation in a vanilla CNN, the proposed EIL explores the high response class-specific area and the less discriminative region simultaneously, thus could maintain high performance in classification and jointly discover the full extent of the object. Furthermore, we apply multiple EIL (MEIL) modules at different levels of the network in a sequential manner, which for the first time integrates semantic features of multiple levels and multiple scales through adversarial erasing learning. In particular, the proposed EIL and advanced MEIL both achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC 2016 benchmark, making significant improvement in localization while advancing high performance in image classification."

With the remarkable success of pair-based metric learning losses, recent works have proposed the use of generated synthetic points on metric learning losses for augmentation and generalization.

Meanwhile, post-processing techniques, such as query expansion and database augmentation, have proposed the combination of feature points to obtain additional semantic information. In this paper, inspired by query expansion and database augmentation, we propose an augmentation method in an embedding space for pair-based metric learning losses, called embedding expansion. The proposed method generates synthetic points containing augmented information by a combination of feature points and performs hard negative pair mining to learn with the most informative feature representations. Because of its simplicity and flexibility, it can be used for existing metric learning losses without affecting model size, training speed, or optimization difficulty.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rprqxMGW6ZU,"We introduce a one-shot segmentation method to alleviate the burden of manual annotation for medical images. The main idea is to treat one-shot segmentation as a classical atlas-based segmentation problem, where voxel-wise correspondence from the atlas to the unlabelled data is learned. Subsequently, segmentation label of the atlas can be transferred to the unlabelled data with the learned correspondence. However, since ground truth correspondence between images is usually unavailable, the learning system must be well-supervised to avoid mode collapse and convergence failure. To overcome this difficulty, we resort to the forward-backward consistency, which is widely used in correspondence problems, and additionally learn the backward correspondences from the warped atlases back to the original atlas. This cycle-correspondence learning design enables a variety of extra, cycle-consistency-based supervision signals to make the training process stable, while also boost the performance. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over both deep learning-based one-shot segmentation methods and a classical multi-atlas segmentation method via thorough experiments."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfo-yeqnQgM,"This paper presents a new method to synthesize an image from arbitrary views and times given a collection of images of a dynamic scene. A key challenge for the novel view synthesis arises from dynamic scene reconstruction where epipolar geometry does not apply to the local motion of dynamic contents. To address this challenge, we propose to combine the depth from single view (DSV) and the depth from multi-view stereo (DMV), where DSV is complete, i.e., a depth is assigned to every pixel, yet view-variant in its scale, while DMV is view-invariant yet incomplete. Our insight is that although its scale and quality are inconsistent with other views, the depth estimation from a single view can be used to reason about the globally coherent geometry of dynamic contents. We cast this problem as learning to correct the scale of DSV, and to refine each depth with locally consistent motions between views to form a coherent depth estimation. We integrate these tasks into a depth fusion network in a self-supervised fashion. Given the fused depth maps, we synthesize a photorealistic virtual view in a specific location and time with our deep blending network that completes the scene and renders the virtual view. We evaluate our method of depth estimation and view synthesis on a diverse real-world dynamic scenes and show the outstanding performance over existing methods."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trl3hW7XtV4,"Camera captured human pose is an outcome of several sources of variation. Performance of supervised 3D pose estimation approaches comes at the cost of dispensing with variations, such as shape and appearance, that may be useful for solving other related tasks. As a result, the learned model not only inculcates task-bias but also dataset-bias because of its strong reliance on the annotated samples, which also holds true for weakly-supervised models. Acknowledging this, we propose a self-supervised learning framework to disentangle such variations from unlabeled video frames. We leverage the prior knowledge on human skeleton and poses in the form of a single part-based 2D puppet model, human pose articulation constraints, and a set of unpaired 3D poses. Our differentiable formalization, bridging the representation gap between the 3D pose and spatial part maps, not only facilitates discovery of interpretable pose disentanglement, but also allows us to operate on videos with diverse camera movements. Qualitative results on unseen in-the-wild datasets establish our superior generalization across multiple tasks beyond the primary tasks of 3D pose estimation and part segmentation.

Despite the general success of end-to-end deep learning paradigms, our approach is based on two key observations: (1) temporal incoherence and jitter are often yielded from a single frame prediction; (2) error rate can be remarkably reduced by increasing the receptive field in a video. Therefore, we design an attentional mechanism to adaptively identify significant frames and tensor outputs from each deep neural net layer, leading to a more optimal estimation. To achieve large temporal receptive fields, multi-scale dilated convolutions are employed to model long-range dependencies among frames. The architecture is straightforward to implement and can be flexibly adopted for real-time applications. Any off-the-shelf 2D pose estimation system, e.g. Mocap libraries, can be easily integrated in an ad-hoc fashion. We both quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method on various standard benchmark datasets (e.g. Human3.6M, HumanEva).

The MARMVS handles the ambiguity in image matching process with three newly proposed strategies: 1) The matching ambiguity is measured by the differential geometry property of image surface with epipolar constraint, which is used as a critical criterion for optimal scale selection of every single pixel with corresponding neighbouring images. 2) The depth of every pixel is initialized to be more close to the true depth by utilizing the depths of its surrounding sparse feature points, which yields faster convergency speed in the following PatchMatch stereo and alleviates the ambiguity introduced by self similar structures of the image. 3) In the last propagation of the PatchMatch stereo, higher priorities are given to those planes with the related 2D image patch possesses less ambiguity, this strategy further propagates a correctly reconstructed surface to raw texture regions. In addition, the proposed method is very efficient even running on consumer grade CPUs, due to proper parameterization and discretization in the depth map computation step. The MARMVS is validated on public benchmarks, and experimental results demonstrate competing performance against the state of the art."

It emphasizes informative features or classes selectively according to the vertical position of a pixel. The pixel-wise class distributions are significantly different from each other among horizontally segmented sections in the urban-scene images. Likewise, urban-scene images have their own distinct characteristics, but most semantic segmentation networks do not reflect such unique attributes in the architecture. The proposed network architecture incorporates the capability exploiting the attributes to handle the urban scene dataset effectively. We validate the consistent performance (mIoU) increase of various semantic segmentation models on two datasets when HANet is adopted. This extensive quantitative analysis demonstrates that adding our module to existing models is easy and cost-effective. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes benchmark with a large margin among ResNet101 based segmentation models. Also, we show that the proposed model is coherent with the facts observed in the urban scene by visualizing and interpreting the attention map. Our code and trained models are publicly available."

In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised method, referred to as video Playback Rate Perception (PRP), to learn spatio-temporal representation in a simple-yet-effective way. PRP roots in a dilated sampling strategy, which produces self-supervision signals about video playback rates for representation model learning. PRP is implemented with a feature encoder, a classification module, and a reconstructing decoder, to achieve spatio-temporal semantic retention in a collaborative discrimination-generation manner. The discriminative perception model follows a feature encoder to prefer perceiving low temporal resolution and long-term representation by classifying fast-forward rates. The generative perception model acts as a feature decoder to focus on comprehending high temporal resolution and short-term representation by introducing a motion-attention mechanism. PRP is applied on typical video target tasks including action recognition and video retrieval. Experiments show that PRP outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised models with significant margins.

Recent RGB HOI benchmarks have been collected either in real or synthetic domain, however, the size of datasets is far from enough to deal with diverse objects combined with hand poses, and 3D pose annotations of real samples are lacking, especially for occluded cases. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable pipeline that adapts the hand-object domain to the single hand-only domain, while learning for HPE. The domain adaption occurs in image space via 2D pixel-level guidance by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and 3D mesh guidance by mesh renderer (MR). Via the domain adaption in image space, not only 3D HPE accuracy is improved, but also HOI input images are translated to segmented and de-occluded hand-only images. The proposed method takes advantages of both the guidances: GAN accurately aligns hands, while MR effectively fills in occluded pixels. The experiments using Dexter-Object, Ego-Dexter and HO3D datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts trained by hand-only data and is comparable to those supervised by HOI data. Note our method is trained primarily by hand-only images with pose labels, and HOI images without pose labels."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcFrBJTgW-c,"Unsupervised image-to-image translation is a central task in computer vision. Current translation frameworks will abandon the discriminator once the training process is completed. This paper contends a novel role of the discriminator by reusing it for encoding the images of the target domain. The proposed architecture, termed as NICE-GAN, exhibits two advantageous patterns over previous approaches: First, it is more compact since no independent encoding component is required; Second, this plug-in encoder is directly trained by the adversary loss, making it more informative and trained more effectively if a multi-scale discriminator is applied. The main issue in NICE-GAN is the coupling of translation with discrimination along the encoder, which could incur training inconsistency when we play the min-max game via GAN. To tackle this issue, we develop a decoupled training strategy by which the encoder is only trained when maximizing the adversary loss while keeping frozen otherwise. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of NICE-GAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of FID, KID, and also human preference. Comprehensive ablation studies are also carried out to isolate the validity of each proposed component. Our codes are available at https://github.com/alpc91/NICE-GAN-pytorch."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYOD-Qnjdl8,"Local and global patterns of an object are closely related. Although each part of an object is incomplete, the underlying attributes about the object are shared among all parts, which makes reasoning the whole object from a single part possible. We hypothesize that a powerful representation of a 3D object should model the attributes that are shared between parts and the whole object, and distinguishable from other objects. Based on this hypothesis, we propose to learn point cloud representation by bidirectional reasoning between the local structures at different abstraction hierarchies and the global shape without human supervision. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the unsupervisedly learned representation is even better than supervised representation in discriminative power, generalization ability, and robustness. We show that unsupervisedly trained point cloud models can outperform their supervised counterparts on downstream classification tasks. Most notably, by simply increasing the channel width of an SSG PointNet++, our unsupervised model surpasses the state-of-the-art supervised methods on both synthetic and real-world 3D object classification datasets. We expect our observations to offer a new perspective on learning better representation from data structures instead of human annotations for point cloud understanding."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YB86Pcd6c,"Cross-modal knowledge distillation deals with transferring knowledge from a model trained with superior modalities (Teacher) to another model trained with weak modalities (Student). Existing approaches require paired training examples exist in both modalities. However, accessing the data from superior modalities may not always be feasible. For example, in the case of 3D hand pose estimation, depth maps, point clouds, or stereo images usually capture better hand structures than RGB images, but most of them are expensive to be collected. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to train the Student in a Target dataset where the Teacher is unavailable. Our key idea is to generalize the distilled cross-modal knowledge learned from a Source dataset, which contains paired examples from both modalities, to the Target dataset by modeling knowledge as priors on parameters of the Student. We name our method ""Cross-Modal Knowledge Generalization"" and demonstrate that our scheme results in competitive performance for 3D hand pose estimation on standard benchmark datasets."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg7a52zObjs,"In this paper, we present TailorNet, a neural model which predicts clothing deformation in 3D as a function of three factors: pose, shape and style (garment geometry), while retaining wrinkle detail. This goes beyond prior models, which are either specific to one style and shape, or generalize to different shapes producing smooth results, despite being style specific. Our hypothesis is that (even non-linear) combinations of examples smoothes out high frequency components such as fine-wrinkles, which makes learning the three factors jointly hard. At the heart of our technique is a decomposition of deformation into a high frequency and a low frequency component. While the low-frequency component is predicted from pose, shape and style parameters with an MLP, the high-frequency component is predicted with a mixture of shape-style specific pose models. The weights of the mixture are computed with a narrow bandwidth kernel to guarantee that only predictions with similar high-frequency patterns are combined. The style variation is obtained by computing, in a canonical pose, a subspace of deformation, which satisfies physical constraints such as inter-penetration, and draping on the body. TailorNet delivers 3D garments which retain the wrinkles from the physics based simulations (PBS) it is learned from, while running more than 1000 times faster. In contrast to classical PBS, TailorNet is easy to use and fully differentiable, which is crucial for computer vision and learning algorithms. Several experiments demonstrate TailorNet produces more realistic results than prior work, and even generates temporally coherent deformations on sequences of the AMASS dataset, despite being trained on static poses from a different dataset. To stimulate further research in this direction, we will make a dataset consisting of 55800 frames, as well as our model publicly available at https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/tailornet/."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87G6umX8HO4,"As an emerging topic in face recognition, designing margin-based loss functions can increase the feature margin between different classes for enhanced discriminability. More recently, the idea of mining-based strategies is adopted to emphasize the misclassified samples, achieving promising results. However, during the entire training process, the prior methods either do not explicitly emphasize the sample based on its importance that renders the hard samples not fully exploited; or explicitly emphasize the effects of semi-hard/hard samples even at the early training stage that may lead to convergence issue. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Curriculum Learning loss (CurricularFace) that embeds the idea of curriculum learning into the loss function to achieve a novel training strategy for deep face recognition, which mainly addresses easy samples in the early training stage and hard ones in the later stage. Specifically, our CurricularFace adaptively adjusts the relative importance of easy and hard samples during different training stages. In each stage, different samples are assigned with different importance according to their corresponding difficultness. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our CurricularFace over the state-of-the-art competitors."

Fundamentally, a sketch is stored as a sequence of data points, a vector format representation, rather than the photo-realistic image of pixels. SketchRNN studied a generative neural representation for sketches of vector format by Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM). Unfortunately, the representation learned by SketchRNN is primarily for the generation tasks, rather than the other tasks of recognition and retrieval of sketches. To this end and inspired by the recent BERT model, we present a model of learning Sketch Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (Sketch-BERT). We generalize BERT to sketch domain, with the novel proposed components and pre-training algorithms, including the newly designed sketch embedding networks, and the self-supervised learning of sketch gestalt. Particularly, towards the pre-training task, we present a novel Sketch Gestalt Model (SGM) to help train the Sketch-BERT.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHOTAFiw0tM,"Despite the remarkable progresses made in deep learning based depth map super-resolution (DSR), how to tackle real-world degradation in low-resolution (LR) depth maps remains a major challenge. Existing DSR model is generally trained and tested on synthetic dataset, which is very different from what would get from a real depth sensor. In this paper, we argue that DSR models trained under this setting are restrictive and not effective in dealing with realworld DSR tasks. We make two contributions in tackling real-world degradation of different depth sensors. First, we propose to classify the generation of LR depth maps into two types: non-linear downsampling with noise and interval downsampling, for which DSR models are learned correspondingly. Second, we propose a new framework for real-world DSR, which consists of four modules : 1) An iterative residual learning module with deep supervision to learn effective high-frequency components of depth maps in a coarse-to-fine manner; 2) A channel attention strategy to enhance channels with abundant high-frequency components; 3) A multi-stage fusion module to effectively reexploit the results in the coarse-to-fine process; and 4) A depth refinement module to improve the depth map by TGV regularization and input loss. Extensive experiments on benchmarking datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-art DSR methods."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJj98eWrpq8,"With the growing prevalence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there is an urgent demand to explain their behaviors. Global explanations contribute to understanding model predictions on a whole category of samples, and thus have attracted increasing interest recently. However, existing methods overwhelmingly conduct separate input attribution or rely on local approximations of models, making them fail to offer faithful global explanations of CNNs. To overcome such drawbacks, we propose a novel two-stage framework, Attacking for Interpretability (AfI), which explains model decisions in terms of the importance of user-defined concepts. AfI first conducts a feature occlusion analysis, which resembles a process of attacking models to derive the category-wide importance of different features. We then map the feature importance to concept importance through ad-hoc semantic tasks. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of AfI and its superiority in providing more accurate estimations of concept importance than existing proposals."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp8eyp8s4Ns,"Face presentation attack detection (PAD) has been an urgent problem to be solved in the face recognition systems. Conventional approaches usually assume the testing and training are within the same domain; as a result, they may not generalize well into unseen scenarios because the representations learned for PAD may overfit to the subjects in the training set. In light of this, we propose an efficient disentangled representation learning for cross-domain face PAD. Our approach consists of disentangled representation learning (DR-Net) and multi-domain learning (MD-Net). DR-Net learns a pair of encoders via generative models that can disentangle PAD informative features from subject discriminative features. The disentangled features from different domains are fed to MD-Net which learns domain-independent features for the final cross-domain face PAD task. Extensive experiments on several public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for cross-domain PAD."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zbbvr5jGhQ,"We address a core problem of computer vision: Detection and description of 2D feature points for image matching. For a long time, hand-crafted designs, like the seminal SIFT algorithm, were unsurpassed in accuracy and efficiency. Recently, learned feature detectors emerged that implement detection and description using neural networks. Training these networks usually resorts to optimizing low-level matching scores, often pre-defining sets of image patches which should or should not match, or which should or should not contain key points. Unfortunately, increased accuracy for these low-level matching scores does not necessarily translate to better performance in high-level vision tasks. We propose a new training methodology which embeds the feature detector in a complete vision pipeline, and where the learnable parameters are trained in an end-to-end fashion. We overcome the discrete nature of key point selection and descriptor matching using principles from reinforcement learning. As an example, we address the task of relative pose estimation between a pair of images. We demonstrate that the accuracy of a state-of-the-art learning-based feature detector can be increased when trained for the task it is supposed to solve at test time. Our training methodology poses little restrictions on the task to learn, and works for any architecture which predicts key point heat maps, and descriptors for key point locations."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L7CUIDZ46c,"Contour shape alignment is a fundamental but challenging problem in computer vision, especially when the observations are partial, noisy, and largely misaligned. Recent ConvNet-based architectures that were proposed to align image structures tend to fail with contour representation of shapes, mostly due to the use of proximity-insensitive pixel-wise similarity measures as loss functions in their training processes. This work presents a novel ConvNet, ""ProAlignNet,"" that accounts for large scale misalignments and complex transformations between the contour shapes. It infers the warp parameters in a multi-scale fashion with progressively increasing complex transformations over increasing scales. It learns --without supervision-- to align contours, agnostic to noise and missing parts, by training with a novel loss function which is derived an upperbound of a proximity-sensitive and local shape-dependent similarity metric that uses classical Morphological Chamfer Distance Transform. We evaluate the reliability of these proposals on a simulated MNIST noisy contours dataset via some basic sanity check experiments. Next, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in two real-world applications of (i) aligning geo-parcel data to aerial image maps and (ii) refining coarsely annotated segmentation labels. In both applications, the proposed models consistently perform superior to state-of-the-art methods."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Xa6h5-9LA,"Recent advances in adaptive object detection have achieved compelling results in virtue of adversarial feature adaptation to mitigate the distributional shifts along the detection pipeline. Whilst adversarial adaptation significantly enhances the transferability of feature representations, the feature discriminability of object detectors remains less investigated. Moreover, transferability and discriminability may come at a contradiction in adversarial adaptation given the complex combinations of objects and the differentiated scene layouts between domains. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Transferability Calibration Network (HTCN) that hierarchically (local-region/image/instance) calibrates the transferability of feature representations for harmonizing transferability and discriminability. The proposed model consists of three components: (1) Importance Weighted Adversarial Training with input Interpolation (IWAT-I), which strengthens the global discriminability by re-weighting the interpolated image-level features; (2) Context-aware Instance-Level Alignment (CILA) module, which enhances the local discriminability by capturing the underlying complementary effect between the instance-level feature and the global context information for the instance-level feature alignment; (3) local feature masks that calibrate the local transferability to provide semantic guidance for the following discriminative pattern alignment. Experimental results show that HTCN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets."

Recently, learned compression methods exhibit a fast development trend with promising results. However, there is still a performance gap between learned compression algorithms and reigning compression standards, especially in terms of widely used PSNR metric. In this paper, we explore the remaining redundancy of recent learned compression algorithms. We have found accurate entropy models for rate estimation largely affect the optimization of network parameters and thus affect the rate-distortion performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to use discretized Gaussian Mixture Likelihoods to parameterize the distributions of latent codes, which can achieve a more accurate and flexible entropy model. Besides, we take advantage of recent attention modules and incorporate them into network architecture to enhance the performance. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art performance compared to existing learned compression methods on both Kodak and high-resolution datasets. To our knowledge our approach is the first work to achieve comparable performance with latest compression standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) regarding PSNR. More importantly, our approach generates more visually pleasant results when optimized by MS-SSIM."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUGbO7caPWE,"Online learning is crucial to robust visual object tracking as it can provide high discrimination power in the presence of background distractors. However, there are two contradictory factors affecting its successful deployment on the real visual tracking platform: the discrimination issue due to the challenges in vanilla gradient descent, which does not guarantee good convergence; the robustness issue due to over-fitting resulting from excessive update with limited memory size (the oldest samples are discarded). Despite many dedicated techniques proposed to somehow treat those issues, in this paper we take a new way to strike a compromise between them based on the recursive least-squares estimation (LSE) algorithm. After connecting each fully-connected layer with LSE separately via normal equations, we further propose an improved mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithm for fully-connected network learning with memory retention in a recursive fashion. This characteristic can spontaneously reduce the risk of over-fitting resulting from catastrophic forgetting in excessive online learning. Meanwhile, it can effectively improve convergence though the cost function is computed over all the training samples that the algorithm has ever seen. We realize this recursive LSE-aided online learning technique in the state-of-the-art RT-MDNet tracker, and the consistent improvements on four challenging benchmarks prove its efficiency without additional offline training and too much tedious work on parameter adjusting."

The current generative models heavily rely on datasets with multi-view images of the same person. Thus, their generated results are restricted by the scale and domain of the data source. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised framework that can synthesize photo-realistic rotated faces using only single-view image collections in the wild. Our key insight is that rotating faces in the 3D space back and forth, and re-rendering them to the 2D plane can serve as a strong self-supervision. We leverage the recent advances in 3D face modeling and high-resolution GAN to constitute our building blocks. Since the 3D rotation-and-render on faces can be applied to arbitrary angles without losing details, our approach is extremely suitable for in-the-wild scenarios (i.e. no paired data are available), where existing methods fall short. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach has superior synthesis quality as well as identity preservation over the state-of-the-art methods, across a wide range of poses and domains. Furthermore, we validate that our rotate-and-render framework naturally can act as an effective data augmentation engine for boosting modern face recognition systems even on strong baseline models"

This effect is independent of the underlying architecture and we show that it can be used to easily detect generated data like deepfakes with up to 100% accuracy on public benchmarks. To overcome this drawback of current generative models, we propose to add a novel spectral regularization term to the training optimization objective. We show that this approach not only allows to train spectral consistent GANs that are avoiding high frequency errors. Also, we show that a correct approximation of the frequency spectrum has positive effects on the training stability and output quality of generative networks."

Being a fundamental component in training and inference, data processing has not been systematically considered in pose estimation community, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we focus on this problem and find that the devil of top-down pose estimator is in the biased data processing. Specifically, by investigating the standard data processing in state-of-the-art approaches mainly including data transformation and encoding-decoding, we find that the results obtained by common flipping strategy are unaligned with the original ones in inference. Moreover, there is statistical error in standard encoding-decoding during both training and inference. Two problems couple together and significantly degrade the pose estimation performance. Based on quantitative analyses, we then formulate a principled way to tackle this dilemma. Data is processed in continuous space based on unit length (the intervals between pixels) instead of in discrete space with pixel, and a combined classification and regression approach is adopted to perform encoding-decoding. The Unbiased Data Processing (UDP) for human pose estimation can be achieved by combining the two together. UDP not only boosts the performance of existing methods by a large margin but also plays a important role in result reproducing and future exploration. As a model-agnostic approach, UDP promotes SimpleBaseline-ResNet50-256x192 by 1.5 AP (70.2 to 71.7) and HRNet-W32-256x192 by 1.7 AP (73.5 to 75.2) on COCO test-dev set.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKIWcVDIQ4U,"Training deep neural networks with spatio-temporal (i.e., 3D) or multidimensional convolutions of higher-order is computationally challenging due to millions of unknown parameters across dozens of layers. To alleviate this, one approach is to apply low-rank tensor decompositions to convolution kernels in order to compress the network and reduce its number of parameters. Alternatively, new convolutional blocks, such as MobileNet, can be directly designed for efficiency. In this paper, we unify these two approaches by proposing a tensor factorization framework for efficient multidimensional (separable) convolutions of higher-order. Interestingly, the proposed framework enables a novel higher-order transduction, allowing to train a network on a given domain (e.g., 2D images or N-dimensional data in general) and using transduction to generalize to higher-order data such as videos (or (N+K)--dimensional data in general), capturing for instance temporal dynamics while preserving the learnt spatial information. We apply the proposed methodology, coined CP-Higher-Order Convolution (HO-CPConv), to spatio-temporal facial emotion analysis. Most existing facial affect models focus on static imagery and discard all temporal information. This is due to the above-mentioned burden of training 3D convolutional nets and the lack of large bodies of video data annotated by experts. We address both issues with our proposed framework. Initial training is first done on static imagery before using transduction to generalize to the temporal domain. We demonstrate superior performance on three challenging large scale affect estimation datasets, AffectNet, SEWA, and AFEW-VA."

These low-level pipelines consist of a sequence of processing blocks that, depending on their hyperparameters, reconstruct a color image from RAW sensor measurements.

Traditionally, ISPs are manually tuned in isolation by imaging experts without an end-to-end objective. Very recently, ISPs have been optimized with 1st-order methods that require differentiable approximations of the hardware ISP. Departing from such approximations, we present a hardware-in-the-loop method that directly optimizes hardware image processing pipelines for end-to-end domain-specific losses by solving a nonlinear multi-objective optimization problem with a novel 0th-order stochastic solver directly interfaced with the hardware ISP. We validate the proposed method with recent hardware ISPs and 2D object detection, segmentation, and human viewing as end-to-end downstream tasks. For automotive 2D object detection, the proposed method outperforms manual expert tuning by 30% mean average precision (mAP) and recent methods using ISP approximations by 18% mAP."

These instances could be closer to the decision boundaries and are important for regularizing the classification and discriminative networks in our class-conditional GANs, which we refer to as R^3-CGAN. Better guidance from these two networks makes the generative network produce instances with class-specific information and high fidelity. We experiment with multiple standard benchmarks, and demonstrate that the R^3-regularization can lead to significant improvement in both classification and class-conditional image synthesis."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDB2HPOziVU,"In this paper, we analyze two popular network compression techniques, i.e. filter pruning and low-rank decomposition, in a unified sense. By simply changing the way the sparsity regularization is enforced, filter pruning and low-rank decomposition can be derived accordingly. This provides another flexible choice for network compression because the techniques complement each other. For example, in popular network architectures with shortcut connections (e.g. ResNet), filter pruning cannot deal with the last convolutional layer in a ResBlock while the low-rank decomposition methods can. In addition, we propose to compress the whole network jointly instead of in a layer-wise manner. Our approach proves its potential as it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art on several benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/ofsoundof/group_sparsity."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI-dAKndhdI,"We explore the behavior of a standard convolutional neural net in a continual-learning setting that introduces visual classification tasks sequentially and requires the net to master new tasks while preserving mastery of previously learned tasks. This setting corresponds to that which human learners face as they acquire domain expertise serially, for example, as an individual studies a textbook. Through simulations involving sequences of ten related visual tasks, we find reason for optimism that nets will scale well as they advance from having a single skill to becoming multi-skill domain experts. We observe two key phenomena. First, forward facilitation---the accelerated learning of task n+1 having learned n previous tasks---grows with n. Second, backward interference---the forgetting of the n previous tasks when learning task n+1 ---diminishes with n. Amplifying forward facilitation is the goal of research on metalearning, and attenuating backward interference is the goal of research on catastrophic forgetting. We find that both of these goals are attained simply through broader exposure to a domain."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OijT2gL7gyA,"We explore the problem of selectively forgetting a particular subset of the data used for training a deep neural network. While the effects of the data to be forgotten can be hidden from the output of the network, insights may still be gleaned by probing deep into its weights. We propose a method for ""scrubbing"" the weights clean of information about a particular set of training data. The method does not require retraining from scratch, nor access to the data originally used for training. Instead, the weights are modified so that any probing function of the weights is indistinguishable from the same function applied to the weights of a network trained without the data to be forgotten. This condition is a generalized and weaker form of Differential Privacy. Exploiting ideas related to the stability of stochastic gradient descent, we introduce an upper-bound on the amount of information remaining in the weights, which can be estimated efficiently even for deep neural networks."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVyEI9310QI,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve translational invariance by using pooling operations. However, the operations do not preserve the spatial relationships in the learned representations. Hence, CNNs cannot extrapolate to various geometric transformations of inputs. Recently, Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have been proposed to tackle this problem. In CapsNets, each entity is represented by a vector and routed to high-level entity representations by a dynamic routing algorithm. CapsNets have been shown to be more robust than CNNs to affine transformations of inputs. However, there is still a huge gap between their performance on transformed inputs compared to untransformed versions. In this work, we first revisit the routing procedure by (un)rolling its forward and backward passes. Our investigation reveals that the routing procedure contributes neither to the generalization ability nor to the affine robustness of the CapsNets. Furthermore, we explore the limitations of capsule transformations and propose affine CapsNets (Aff-CapsNets), which are more robust to affine transformations. On our benchmark task, where models are trained on the MNIST dataset and tested on the AffNIST dataset, our Aff-CapsNets improve the benchmark performance by a large margin (from 79% to 93.21%), without using any routing mechanism."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrVQvTrdrw,"Modern face alignment methods have become quite accurate at predicting the locations of facial landmarks, but they do not typically estimate the uncertainty of their predicted locations nor predict whether landmarks are visible. In this paper, we present a novel framework for jointly predicting landmark locations, associated uncertainties of these predicted locations, and landmark visibilities. We model these as mixed random variables and estimate them using a deep network trained using our proposed Location, Uncertainty, and Visibility Likelihood (LUVLi) loss. In addition, we release an entirely new labeling of a large face alignment dataset with over 19,000 face images in a full range of head poses. Each face is manually labeled with the ground-truth locations of 68 landmarks, with the additional information of whether each landmarks is visible, self-occluded (due to extreme head poses), or externally occluded. Not only does our joint estimation yield accurate estimates of the uncertainty of predicted landmark locations, but it also yields state-of-the-art estimates for the landmark locations themselves on mulitple standard face alignment datasets. Our method's estimates of the uncertainty of predicted landmark locations could be used to automatically identify input images on which face alignment fails, which can be critical for downstream tasks."

Moreover, we formulate a learnable point augmentation function with a shape-wise transformation and a point-wise displacement, and carefully design loss functions to adopt the augmented samples based on the learning progress of the classifier.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IAkpHrnkoU,"One of the attractive characteristics of deep neural networks is their ability to transfer knowledge obtained in one domain to other related domains. As a result, high-quality networks can be trained in domains with relatively little training data. This property has been extensively studied for discriminative networks but has received significantly less attention for generative models. Given the often enormous effort required to train GANs, both computationally as well as in the dataset collection, the re-use of pretrained GANs is a desirable objective. We propose a novel knowledge transfer method for generative models based on mining the knowledge that is most beneficial to a specific target domain, either from a single or multiple pretrained GANs. This is done using a miner network that identifies which part of the generative distribution of each pretrained GAN outputs samples closest to the target domain. Mining effectively steers GAN sampling towards suitable regions of the latent space, which facilitates the posterior finetuning and avoids pathologies of other methods such as mode collapse and lack of flexibility. We perform experiments on several complex datasets using various GAN architectures (BigGAN, Progressive GAN) and show that the proposed method, called MineGAN, effectively transfers knowledge to domains with few target images, outperforming existing methods. In addition, MineGAN can successfully transfer knowledge from multiple pretrained GANs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/yaxingwang/MineGAN."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=160zaip0i0E,"Combinatorial optimization is frequently used in computer vision. For instance, in applications like semantic segmentation, human pose estimation and action recognition, programs are formulated for solving inference in Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to produce a structured output that is consistent with visual features of the image. However, solving inference in CRFs is in general intractable, and approximation methods are computationally demanding and limited to unary, pairwise and hand-crafted forms of higher order potentials. In this paper, we show that we can learn program heuristics, i.e., policies, for solving inference in higher order CRFs for the task of semantic segmentation, using reinforcement learning. Our method solves inference tasks efficiently without imposing any constraints on the form of the potentials. We show compelling results on the Pascal VOC and MOTS datasets."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ADU0XWS6Rk,"Recent works based on deep learning and facial priors have succeeded in super-resolving severely degraded facial images. However, the prior knowledge is not fully exploited in existing methods, since facial priors such as landmark and component maps are always estimated by low-resolution or coarsely super-resolved images, which may be inaccurate and thus affect the recovery performance. In this paper, we propose a deep face super-resolution (FSR) method with iterative collaboration between two recurrent networks which focus on facial image recovery and landmark estimation respectively. In each recurrent step, the recovery branch utilizes the prior knowledge of landmarks to yield higher-quality images which facilitate more accurate landmark estimation in turn. Therefore, the iterative information interaction between two processes boosts the performance of each other progressively. Moreover, a new attentive fusion module is designed to strengthen the guidance of landmark maps, where facial components are generated individually and aggregated attentively for better restoration. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FSR methods in recovering high-quality face images."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHKv-Om-S-4,"Data augmentation is an effective way to improve the performance of deep networks. Unfortunately, current methods are mostly developed for high-level vision tasks (e.g., classification) and few are studied for low-level vision tasks (e.g., image restoration). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing augmentation methods applied to the super-resolution task. We find that the methods discarding or manipulating the pixels or features too much hamper the image restoration, where the spatial relationship is very important. Based on our analyses, we propose CutBlur that cuts a low-resolution patch and pastes it to the corresponding high-resolution image region and vice versa. The key intuition of CutBlur is to enable a model to learn not only ""how"" but also ""where"" to super-resolve an image. By doing so, the model can understand ""how much"", instead of blindly learning to apply super-resolution to every given pixel. Our method consistently and significantly improves the performance across various scenarios, especially when the model size is big and the data is collected under real-world environments. We also show that our method improves other low-level vision tasks, such as denoising and compression artifact removal."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yVlvrZSGcE,"Event cameras sense intensity changes and have many advantages over conventional cameras. To take advantage of event cameras, some methods have been proposed to reconstruct intensity images from event streams. However, the outputs are still in low resolution (LR), noisy, and unrealistic. The low-quality outputs stem broader applications of event cameras, where high spatial resolution (HR) is needed as well as high temporal resolution, dynamic range, and no motion blur. We consider the problem of reconstructing and super-resolving intensity images from pure events, when no ground truth (GT) HR images and down-sampling kernels are available. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end pipeline that reconstructs LR images from event streams, enhances the image qualities and upsamples the enhanced images, called EventSR. For the absence of real GT images, our method is primarily unsupervised, deploying adversarial learning. To train EventSR, we create an open dataset including both real-world and simulated scenes. The use of both datasets boosts up the network performance, and the network architectures and various loss functions in each phase help improve the image qualities. The whole pipeline is trained in three phases. While each phase is mainly for one of the three tasks, the networks in earlier phases are fine-tuned by respective loss functions in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that EventSR generates high-quality SR images from events for both simulated and real-world data."

We provide protocol designs and parameter derivations for number-theoretic transform (NTT) based FDSC. In the experiment, we thoroughly study the accuracy-efficiency trade-offs between time- and frequency-domain homomorphic convolution. With ENSEI, compared to the best known works, we achieve 5--11x online time reduction, up to 33x setup time reduction, and up to 10x reduction in the overall inference time. A further 33% of bandwidth reductions can be obtained on binary neural networks with only 3% of accuracy degradation on the CIFAR-10 dataset."

In order to effectively address this problem, this work firstly introduces a bijective metric so that the distance measurement and metric learning process can be directly adopted in image domain for an image reconstruction task. Secondly, a distillation process is introduced to maximize the information exploited from the blackbox face recognition engine. Then a Feature-Conditional Generator Structure with Exponential Weighting Strategy is presented for a more robust generator that can synthesize realistic faces with ID preservation.

Different from state-of-the-art trackers like Siamese-RPN, SiamRPN++ and SPM, which are based on region proposal, the proposed framework is both proposal and anchor free. Consequently, we are able to avoid the tricky hyper-parameter tuning of anchors and reduce human intervention. The proposed framework is simple, neat and effective. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art trackers are conducted on challenging benchmarks including GOT-10K, LaSOT, UAV123 and OTB-50.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD8jh--0T-Y,"""Like night and day"" is a commonly used expression to imply that two things are completely different. Unfortunately, this tends to be the case for current visual feature representations of the same scene across varying seasons or times of day. The aim of this paper is to provide a dense feature representation that can be used to perform localization, sparse matching or image retrieval, regardless of the current seasonal or temporal appearance. Recently, there have been several proposed methodologies for deep learning dense feature representations. These methods make use of ground truth pixel-wise correspondences between pairs of images and focus on the spatial properties of the features. As such, they don't address temporal or seasonal variation. Furthermore, obtaining the required pixel-wise correspondence data to train in cross-seasonal environments is highly complex in most scenarios. We propose Deja-Vu, a weakly supervised approach to learning season invariant features that does not require pixel-wise ground truth data. The proposed system only requires coarse labels indicating if two images correspond to the same location or not. From these labels, the network is trained to produce ""similar"" dense feature maps for corresponding locations despite environmental changes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvFkgqRpVEY,"While many works focus on 3D reconstruction from images, in this paper, we focus on 3D shape reconstruction and completion from a variety of 3D inputs, which are deficient in some respect: low and high resolution voxels, sparse and dense point clouds, complete or incomplete. Processing of such 3D inputs is an increasingly important problem as they are the output of 3D scanners, which are becoming more accessible, and are the intermediate output of 3D computer vision algorithms. Recently, learned implicit functions have shown great promise as they produce continuous reconstructions. However, we identified two limitations in reconstruction from 3D inputs: 1) details present in the input data are not retained, and 2) poor reconstruction of articulated humans. To solve this, we propose Implicit Feature Networks (IF-Nets), which deliver continuous outputs, can handle multiple topologies, and complete shapes for missing or sparse input data retaining the nice properties of recent learned implicit functions, but critically they can also retain detail when it is present in the input data, and can reconstruct articulated humans. Our work differs from prior work in two crucial aspects. First, instead of using a single vector to encode a 3D shape, we extract a learnable 3-dimensional multi-scale tensor of deep features, which is aligned with the original Euclidean space embedding the shape. Second, instead of classifying x-y-z point coordinates directly, we classify deep features extracted from the tensor at a continuous query point. We show that this forces our model to make decisions based on global and local shape structure, as opposed to point coordinates, which are arbitrary under Euclidean transformations. Experiments demonstrate that IF-Nets outperform prior work in 3D object reconstruction in ShapeNet, and obtain significantly more accurate 3D human reconstructions.

In contrast to conventional algorithms which utilize brute-force searches or optical flow estimations, the proposed algorithm is end-to-end trainable without any additional supervision or heavy computation, predicting the best match with a single network forward operation. Moreover, the proposed module is aware of not only the best matching position but also the relevancy of the best match. This makes our algorithm substantially robust when irrelevant reference images are given, overcoming the major cause of the performance degradation when using existing RefSR methods. Furthermore, our module can be utilized for self-similarity SR if no reference image is available. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to previous works both quantitatively and qualitatively."

Existing datasets used to train such algorithms are primarily made up of only low resolution images, and current algorithms are limited to inputs of comparable quality and resolution as the training dataset. On the other hand, high resolution imagery is becoming increasingly more common as consumer cameras improve in quality every year. Therefore, there is need for algorithms that can leverage the rich information available in high resolution imagery. Naively attempting to reuse existing network architectures on high resolution imagery is prohibitive due to memory bottlenecks on GPUs. The only current solution is to downsample the images, sacrificing resolution and quality. Building on top of recent progress in attention-based networks, we present a novel, fully convolutional regional architecture that is specially designed for predicting landmarks on very high resolution facial images without downsampling. We demonstrate the flexibility of our architecture by training the proposed model with images of resolutions ranging from 256 x 256 to 4K. In addition to being the first method for facial landmark detection on high resolution images, our approach achieves superior performance over traditional (holistic) state-of-the-art architectures across ALL resolutions, leading to a general-purpose, extremely flexible, high quality landmark detector."

Face quality assessment aims at estimating the suitability of a face image for the purpose of recognition. Previous work proposed supervised solutions that require artificially or human labelled quality values. However, both labelling mechanisms are error prone as they do not rely on a clear definition of quality and may not know the best characteristics for the utilized face recognition system. Avoiding the use of inaccurate quality labels, we proposed a novel concept to measure face quality based on an arbitrary face recognition model. By determining the embedding variations generated from random subnetworks of a face model, the robustness of a sample representation and thus, its quality is estimated. The experiments are conducted in a cross-database evaluation setting on three publicly available databases. We compare our proposed solution on two face embeddings against six state-of-the-art approaches from academia and industry. The results show that our unsupervised solution outperforms all other approaches in the majority of the investigated scenarios. In contrast to previous works, the proposed solution shows a stable performance over all scenarios.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WexHfLVMZQs,"3D Multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial to autonomous systems. Recent work uses a standard tracking-by-detection pipeline, where feature extraction is first performed independently for each object in order to compute an affinity matrix. Then the affinity matrix is passed to the Hungarian algorithm for data association. A key process of this standard pipeline is to learn discriminative features for different objects in order to reduce confusion during data association. In this work, we propose two techniques to improve the discriminative feature learning for MOT: (1) instead of obtaining features for each object independently, we propose a novel feature interaction mechanism by introducing the Graph Neural Network. As a result, the feature of one object is informed of the features of other objects so that the object feature can lean towards the object with similar feature (i.e., object probably with a same ID) and deviate from objects with dissimilar features (i.e., object probably with different IDs), leading to a more discriminative feature for each object; (2) instead of obtaining the feature from either 2D or 3D space in prior work, we propose a novel joint feature extractor to learn appearance and motion features from 2D and 3D space simultaneously. As features from different modalities often have complementary information, the joint feature can be more discriminate than feature from each individual modality. To ensure that the joint feature extractor does not heavily rely on one modality, we also propose an ensemble training paradigm. Through extensive evaluation, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and nuScenes 3D MOT benchmarks.

To encourage fairness, we introduce the idea of adaptive margin to learn balanced performance for different races based on large margin losses. A reinforcement learning based race balance network (RL-RBN) is proposed. We formulate the process of finding the optimal margins for non-Caucasians as a Markov decision process and employ deep Q-learning to learn policies for an agent to select appropriate margin by approximating the Q-value function. Guided by the agent, the skewness of feature scatter between races can be reduced. Besides, we provide two ethnicity aware training datasets, called BUPT-Globalface and BUPT-Balancedface dataset, which can be utilized to study racial bias from both data and algorithm aspects. Extensive experiments on RFW database show that RL-RBN successfully mitigates racial bias and learns more balanced performance."

However, the images of an identity can be visually discrepant when images are taken under different states, e.g. different camera views and poses. This visual discrepancy leads to great difficulty in unsupervised discriminative learning. Fortunately, in real-world tasks we could often know the states without human annotation, e.g. we can easily have the camera view labels in person re-identification and facial pose labels in face recognition. In this work we propose utilizing the state information as weak supervision to address the visual discrepancy caused by different states. We formulate a simple pseudo label model and utilize the state information in an attempt to refine the assigned pseudo labels by the weakly supervised decision boundary rectification and weakly supervised feature drift regularization. We evaluate our model on unsupervised person re-identification and pose-invariant face recognition. Despite the simplicity of our method, it could outperform the state-of-the-art results on Duke-reID, MultiPIE and CFP datasets with a standard ResNet-50 backbone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgvzANZU-I4,"Batch Normalization (BN) techniques have been proposed to reduce the so-called Internal Covariate Shift (ICS) by attempting to keep the distributions of layer outputs unchanged. Experiments have shown their effectiveness on training deep neural networks. However, since only the first two moments are controlled in these BN techniques, it seems that a weak constraint is imposed on layer distributions and furthermore whether such constraint can reduce ICS is unknown. Thus this paper proposes a measure for ICS by using the Earth Mover (EM) distance and then derives the upper and lower bounds for the measure to provide a theoretical analysis of BN. The upper bound has shown that BN techniques can control ICS only for the outputs with low dimensions and small noise whereas their control is not effective in other cases. This paper also proves that such control is just a bounding of ICS rather than a reduction of ICS. Meanwhile, the analysis shows that the high-order moments and noise, which BN cannot control, have great impact on the lower bound. Based on such analysis, this paper furthermore proposes an algorithm that unitizes the outputs with an adjustable parameter to further bound ICS in order to cope with the problems of BN. The upper bound for the proposed unitization is noise-free and only dominated by the parameter. Thus, the parameter can be trained to tune the bound and further to control ICS. Besides, the unitization is embedded into the framework of BN to reduce the information loss. The experiments show that this proposed algorithm outperforms existing BN techniques on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets."

MixNMatch requires bounding boxes during training to model background, but requires no other supervision. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate MixNMatch's ability to accurately disentangle, encode, and combine multiple factors for mix-and-match image generation, including sketch2color, cartoon2img, and img2gif applications.

While the VOS task can be naturally decoupled into image semantic segmentation and video object tracking, significantly much more research effort has been made in segmentation than tracking. In this paper, we introduce ""tracking-by-detection"" into VOS which can coherently integrates segmentation into tracking, by proposing a new temporal aggregation network and a novel dynamic time-evolving template matching mechanism to achieve significantly improved performance. Notably, our method is entirely online and thus suitable for one-shot learning, and our end-to-end trainable model allows multiple object segmentation in one forward pass. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the DAVIS benchmark without complicated bells and whistles in both speed and accuracy, with a speed of 0.14 second per frame and J &F measure of 75.9% respectively."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoCTS0-kYZc,"Applying data-driven approaches to non-rigid 3D reconstruction has been difficult, which we believe can be attributed to the lack of a large-scale training corpus. Unfortunately, this method fails for important cases such as highly non-rigid deformations. We first address this problem of lack of data by introducing a novel semi-supervised strategy to obtain dense inter-frame correspondences from a sparse set of annotations. This way, we obtain a large dataset of 400 scenes, over 390,000 RGB-D frames, and 5,533 densely aligned frame pairs; in addition, we provide a test set along with several metrics for evaluation. Based on this corpus, we introduce a data-driven non-rigid feature matching approach, which we integrate into an optimization-based reconstruction pipeline. Here, we propose a new neural network that operates on RGB-D frames, while maintaining robustness under large non-rigid deformations and producing accurate predictions. Our approach significantly outperforms existing non-rigid reconstruction methods that do not use learned data terms, as well as learning-based approaches that only use self-supervision."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7iBQpwjfk8,"Current popular online multi-object tracking (MOT) solutions apply single object trackers (SOTs) to capture object motions, while often requiring an extra affinity network to associate objects, especially for the occluded ones. This brings extra computational overhead due to repetitive feature extraction for SOT and affinity computation. Meanwhile, the model size of the sophisticated affinity network is usually non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a novel MOT framework that unifies object motion and affinity model into a single network, named UMA, in order to learn a compact feature that is discriminative for both object motion and affinity measure. In particular, UMA integrates single object tracking and metric learning into a unified triplet network by means of multi-task learning. Such design brings advantages of improved computation efficiency, low memory requirement and simplified training procedure. In addition, we equip our model with a task-specific attention module, which is used to boost task-aware feature learning. The proposed UMA can be easily trained end-to-end, and is elegant - requiring only one training stage. Experimental results show that it achieves promising performance on several MOT Challenge benchmarks."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9yR5esPcUg,"In this work, we introduce a novel local pairwise descriptor and then develop a simple, effective iterative method to solve the resulting quadratic assignment through sparsity control for shape correspondence between two approximate isometric surfaces. Our pairwise descriptor is based on the stiffness and mass matrix of finite element approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami differential operator, which is local in space, sparse to represent, and extremely easy to compute while containing global information. It allows us to deal with open surfaces, partial matching, and topological perturbations robustly. To solve the resulting quadratic assignment problem efficiently, the two key ideas of our iterative algorithm are: 1) select pairs with good (approximate) correspondence as anchor points, 2) solve a regularized quadratic assignment problem only in the neighborhood of selected anchor points through sparsity control. These two ingredients can improve and increase the number of anchor points quickly while reducing the computation cost in each quadratic assignment iteration significantly. With enough high-quality anchor points, one may use various pointwise global features with reference to these anchor points to further improve the dense shape correspondence. We use various experiments to show the efficiency, quality, and versatility of our method on large data sets, patches, and point clouds (without global meshes)."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIhttRSMqjE,"The requirement of fine-grained perception by autonomous driving systems has resulted in recently increased research in the online semantic segmentation of single-scan LiDAR. Emerging datasets and technological advancements have enabled researchers to benchmark this problem and improve the applicable semantic segmentation algorithms. Still, online semantic segmentation of LiDAR scans in autonomous driving applications remains challenging due to three reasons: (1) the need for near-real-time latency with limited hardware, (2) points are distributed unevenly across space, and (3) an increasing number of more fine-grained semantic classes. The combination of the aforementioned challenges motivates us to propose a new LiDAR-specific, KNN-free segmentation algorithm - PolarNet. Instead of using common spherical or bird's-eye-view projection, our polar bird's-eye-view representation balances the points per grid and thus indirectly redistributes the network's attention over the long-tailed points distribution over the radial axis in polar coordination. We find that our encoding scheme greatly increases the mIoU in three drastically different real urban LiDAR single-scan segmentation datasets while retaining ultra low latency and near real-time throughput."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLEQB5QUOtQ,"State-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods were almost exclusively trained on images within a fixed resolution range. These segmentations are inaccurate for very high-resolution images since using bicubic upsampling of low-resolution segmentation does not adequately capture high-resolution details along object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address the high-resolution segmentation problem without using any high-resolution training data. The key insight is our CascadePSP network which refines and corrects local boundaries whenever possible. Although our network is trained with low-resolution segmentation data, our method is applicable to any resolution even for very high-resolution images larger than 4K. We present quantitative and qualitative studies on different datasets to show that CascadePSP can reveal pixel-accurate segmentation boundaries using our novel refinement module without any finetuning. Thus, our method can be regarded as class-agnostic. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our model to scene parsing in multi-class segmentation."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eJ2aOEKv58,"Deep convolution-based single image super-resolution (SISR) networks embrace the benefits of learning from large-scale external image resources for local recovery, yet most existing works have ignored the long-range feature-wise similarities in natural images. Some recent works have successfully leveraged this intrinsic feature correlation by exploring non-local attention modules. However, none of the current deep models have studied another inherent property of images: cross-scale feature correlation. In this paper, we propose the first Cross-Scale Non-Local (CS-NL) attention module with integration into a recurrent neural network. By combining the new CS-NL prior with local and in-scale non-local priors in a powerful recurrent fusion cell, we can find more cross-scale feature correlations within a single low-resolution (LR) image. The performance of SISR is significantly improved by exhaustively integrating all possible priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CS-NL module by setting new state-of-the-arts on multiple SISR benchmarks."

Unlike previous methods that either require extensive training data or operate on handcrafted input descriptors and thus generalize poorly across diverse datasets, our approach is both accurate and robust to changes in shape structure. Key to our method is a feature-extraction network that learns directly from raw shape geometry, combined with a novel regularized map extraction layer and loss, based on the functional map representation. We demonstrate through extensive experiments in challenging shape matching scenarios that our method can learn from less training data than existing supervised approaches and generalizes significantly better than current descriptor-based learning methods.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9ouWEwyTPg,"Existing automatic 3D image segmentation methods usually fail to meet the clinic use. Many studies have explored an interactive strategy to improve the image segmentation performance by iteratively incorporating user hints. However, the dynamic process for successive interactions is largely ignored. We here propose to model the dynamic process of iterative interactive image segmentation as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it with reinforcement learning (RL). Unfortunately, it is intractable to use single-agent RL for voxel-wise prediction due to the large exploration space. To reduce the exploration space to a tractable size, we treat each voxel as an agent with a shared voxel-level behavior strategy so that it can be solved with multi-agent reinforcement learning. An additional advantage of this multi-agent model is to capture the dependency among voxels for segmentation task. Meanwhile, to enrich the information of previous segmentations, we reserve the prediction uncertainty in the state space of MDP and derive an adjustment action space leading to a more precise and finer segmentation. In addition, to improve the efficiency of exploration, we design a relative cross-entropy gain-based reward to update the policy in a constrained direction. Experimental results on various medical datasets have shown that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with the advantage of less interactions and a faster convergence."

The manifold projection module and the generation module are combined to learn one-to-one image mapping between two spaces in an unsupervised way by projecting instance image space and conditional completion image space into common low-dimensional manifold space, which can greatly improve the diversity of the repaired samples. For understanding of global information, we also introduce a new cross semantic attention layer that exploits the long-range dependencies between the known parts and the completed parts, which can improve realism and appearance consistency of repaired samples. Extensive experiments on various datasets such as CelebA-HQ, Places2, Paris Street View and ImageNet clearly demonstrate that our method not only generates diverse inpainting solutions from the same image to be repaired, but also has high image quality."

Despite the fast evolution of learning-based 3D feature descriptors, little attention has been drawn to the learning of 3D feature detectors, even less for a joint learning of the two tasks. In this paper, we leverage a 3D fully convolutional network for 3D point clouds, and propose a novel and practical learning mechanism that densely predicts both a detection score and a description feature for each 3D point. In particular, we propose a keypoint selection strategy that overcomes the inherent density variations of 3D point clouds, and further propose a self-supervised detector loss guided by the on-the-fly feature matching results during training. Finally, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, evaluated on 3DMatch and KITTI datasets, and shows its strong generalization ability on the ETH dataset.

The user can move, rotate and scale an object, change its appearance and texture or modify the position of the light and all these edits are represented in the final rendering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by rendering scenes with varying appearance, from single color per object to complex, high-frequency textures. We show that our rerendering network can generate very detailed images that represent precisely the appearance of the input scene. Our experiments illustrate that our approach achieves more accurate image synthesis results compared to alternatives and can also handle low voxel grid resolutions.

However, this approach also introduces multi-model forgetting during the supernet training (architecture search phase), where the performance of previous architectures degrade when sequentially training new architectures with partially-shared weights. To overcome such catastrophic forgetting, the state-of-the-art method assumes that the shared weights are optimal when jointly optimizing a posterior probability. However, this strict assumption is not necessarily held for One-Shot NAS in practice. In this paper, we formulate the supernet training in the One-Shot NAS as a constrained optimization problem of continual learning that the learning of current architecture should not degrade the performance of previous architectures during the supernet training. We propose a Novelty Search based Architecture Selection (NSAS) loss function and demonstrate that the posterior probability could be calculated without the strict assumption when maximizing the diversity of the selected constraints. A greedy novelty search method is devised to find the most representative subset to regularize the supernet training.

However, these efforts were focused on close-range objects and only a very few of the deep learning-based methods were specifically designed for large-scale 3D urban reconstruction due to the lack of multi-view aerial image benchmarks. In this paper, we present a synthetic aerial dataset, called the WHU dataset, we created for MVS tasks, which, to our knowledge, is the first large-scale multi-view aerial dataset. It was generated from a highly accurate 3D digital surface model produced from thousands of real aerial images with precise camera parameters. We also introduce in this paper a novel network, called RED-Net, for wide-range depth inference, which we developed from a recurrent encoder-decoder structure to regularize cost maps across depths and a 2D fully convolutional network as framework. RED-Net's low memory requirements and high performance make it suitable for large-scale and highly accurate 3D Earth surface reconstruction. Our experiments confirmed that not only did our method exceed the current state-of-the-art MVS methods by more than 50% mean absolute error (MAE) with less memory and computational cost, but its efficiency as well. It outperformed one of the best commercial software programs based on conventional methods, improving their efficiency 16 times over.

To address these issues, we propose Pose and expression robust Spatial-aware GAN (PSGAN). It first utilizes Makeup Distill Network to disentangle the makeup of the reference image as two spatial-aware makeup matrices.

At first, we use a CNN backbone to learn feature maps and key-points estimation model to extract semantic local features. Even so, occluded images still suffer from occlusion and outliers. Then, we view the extracted local features of an image as nodes of a graph and propose an adaptive direction graph convolutional (ADGC) layer to pass relation information between nodes. The proposed ADGC layer can automatically suppress the message passing of meaningless features by dynamically learning direction and degree of linkage. When aligning two groups of local features, we view it as a graph matching problem and propose a cross-graph embedded-alignment (CGEA) layer to joint learn and embed topology information to local features, and straightly predict similarity score. The proposed CGEA layer can both take full use of alignment learned by graph matching and replace sensitive one-to-one alignment with a robust soft one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs6Atib6KtY,"Extracting road graphs from aerial images automatically is more efficient and costs less than from field acquisition. This can be done by a post-processing step that vectorizes road segmentation predicted by CNN, but imperfect predictions will result in road graphs with low connectivity. On the other hand, iterative next move exploration could construct road graphs with better road connectivity, but often focuses on local information and does not provide precise alignment with the real road. To enhance the road connectivity while maintaining the precise alignment between the graph and real road, we propose a point-based iterative graph exploration scheme with segmentation-cues guidance and flexible steps. In our approach, we represent the location of the next move as a 'point' that unifies the representation of multiple constraints such as the direction and step size in each moving step. Information cues such as road segmentation and road junctions are jointly detected and utilized to guide the next move and achieve better alignment of roads. We demonstrate that our proposed method has a considerable improvement over state-of-the-art road graph extraction methods in terms of F-measure and road connectivity metrics on common datasets."

A simple and efficient selection algorithm with a linear complexity order, referred to as spectrum pursuit (SP), is proposed that pursuits spectral components of the dataset using available sample points. The proposed non-greedy algorithm aims to iteratively find K data samples whose span is close to that of the first K spectral components of entire data. SP has no parameter to be fine tuned and this desirable property makes it problem-independent.

To obtain a smooth and straightforward transition, one may adopt the well-known Wasserstein Barycenter Problem (WBP). While this approach guarantees minimal changes under the Wasserstein metric, the resulting images might seem unnatural. In this work, we propose a novel approach for image morphing that possesses all three desired properties.

It first re-weights the neighbors around the initial sampled points from farthest point sampling (FPS), and then adaptively adjusts the sampled points beyond the entire point cloud. Our AS module can not only benefit the feature learning of point clouds, but also ease the biased effect of outliers. To further capture the neighbor and long-range dependencies of the sampled point, we proposed a local-nonlocal (L-NL) module inspired by the nonlocal operation. Such L-NL module enables the learning process insensitive to noise. Extensive experiments verify the robustness and superiority of our approach in point clouds processing tasks regardless of synthesis data, indoor data, and outdoor data with or without noise.

As depth estimation of object is the key factor affecting the performance of 3D object detection, we introduce an Instance-DepthAware (IDA) module which accurately predicts the depth of the 3D bounding box's center by instance-depth awareness, disparity adaptation and matching cost reweighting. Moreover, our model is an end-to-end learning framework which does not require multiple stages or postprocessing algorithm. We provide detailed experiments on KITTI benchmark and achieve impressive improvements compared with the existing image-based methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/swords123/IDA-3D."

There have been several 2D and 3D keypoint datasets aiming to address this problem in a data-driven way. These datasets, however, either lack scalability or bring ambiguity to the definition of keypoints. Therefore, we present KeypointNet: the first large-scale and diverse 3D keypoint dataset that contains 83,231 keypoints and 8,329 3D models from 16 object categories, by leveraging numerous human annotations. To handle the inconsistency between annotations from different people, we propose a novel method to aggregate these keypoints automatically, through minimization of a fidelity loss. Finally, ten state-of-the-art methods are benchmarked on our proposed dataset."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnchEvVhI3c,"Object detection has been dominated by anchor-based detectors for several years. Recently, anchor-free detectors have become popular due to the proposal of FPN and Focal Loss. In this paper, we first point out that the essential difference between anchor-based and anchor-free detection is actually how to define positive and negative training samples, which leads to the performance gap between them. If they adopt the same definition of positive and negative samples during training, there is no obvious difference in the final performance, no matter regressing from a box or a point. This shows that how to select positive and negative training samples is important for current object detectors. Then, we propose an Adaptive Training Sample Selection (ATSS) to automatically select positive and negative samples according to statistical characteristics of object. It significantly improves the performance of anchor-based and anchor-free detectors and bridges the gap between them. Finally, we discuss the necessity of tiling multiple anchors per location on the image to detect objects. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO support our aforementioned analysis and conclusions. With the newly introduced ATSS, we improve state-of-the-art detectors by a large margin to 50.7% AP without introducing any overhead. The code is available at https://github.com/sfzhang15/ATSS."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS0yKbKYSKY,"Existing weakly supervised fine-grained image recognition (WFGIR) methods usually pick out the discriminative regions from the high-level feature maps directly. We discover that due to the operation of stacking local receptive filed, Convolutional Neural Network causes the discriminative region diffusion in high-level feature maps, which leads to inaccurate discriminative region localization. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Discriminative Feature-oriented Gaussian Mixture Model (DF-GMM), to address the problem of discriminative region diffusion and find better fine-grained details. Specifically, DF-GMM consists of 1) a low-rank representation mechanism (LRM), which learns a set of low-rank discriminative bases by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in high-level semantic feature maps to improve discriminative ability of feature representation, 2) a low-rank representation reorganization mechanism (LR ^2 M) which resumes the space information corresponding to low-rank discriminative bases to reconstruct the low-rank feature maps. It alleviates the discriminative region diffusion problem and locate discriminative regions more precisely. Extensive experiments verify that DF-GMM yields the best performance under the same settings with the most competitive approaches, in CUB-Bird, Stanford-Cars datasets, and FGVC Aircraft."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwcXWsQli8E,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is crucial to tackle the lack of annotations in a new domain. There are many multi-modal datasets, but most UDA approaches are uni-modal. In this work, we explore how to learn from multi-modality and propose cross-modal UDA (xMUDA) where we assume the presence of 2D images and 3D point clouds for 3D semantic segmentation. This is challenging as the two input spaces are heterogeneous and can be impacted differently by domain shift. In xMUDA, modalities learn from each other through mutual mimicking, disentangled from the segmentation objective, to prevent the stronger modality from adopting false predictions from the weaker one. We evaluate on new UDA scenarios including day-to-night, country-to-country and dataset-to-dataset, leveraging recent autonomous driving datasets. xMUDA brings large improvements over uni-modal UDA on all tested scenarios, and is complementary to state-of-the-art UDA techniques.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3q5IS2kGCw,"The majority of current object detectors lack context: class predictions are made independently from other detections. We propose to incorporate context in object detection by post-processing the output of an arbitrary detector to rescore the confidences of its detections. Rescoring is done by conditioning on contextual information from the entire set of detections: their confidences, predicted classes, and positions. We show that AP can be improved by simply reassigning the detection confidence values such that true positives that survive longer (i.e., those with the correct class and large IoU) are scored higher than false positives or detections with small IoU. In this setting, we use a bidirectional RNN with attention for contextual rescoring and introduce a training target that uses the IoU with ground truth to maximize AP for the given set of detections. The fact that our approach does not require access to visual features makes it computationally inexpensive and agnostic to the detection architecture. In spite of this simplicity, our model consistently improves AP over strong pre-trained baselines (Cascade R-CNN and Faster R-CNN with several backbones), particularly by reducing the confidence of duplicate detections (a learned form of non-maximum suppression) and removing out-of-context objects by conditioning on the confidences, classes, positions, and sizes of the co-occurrent detections.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSSowWWKwog,"In this paper we challenge the common assumption that convolutional layers in modern CNNs are translation invariant. We show that CNNs can and will exploit the absolute spatial location by learning filters that respond exclusively to particular absolute locations by exploiting image boundary effects. Because modern CNNs filters have a huge receptive field, these boundary effects operate even far from the image boundary, allowing the network to exploit absolute spatial location all over the image. We give a simple solution to remove spatial location encoding which improves translation invariance and thus gives a stronger visual inductive bias which particularly benefits small data sets. We broadly demonstrate these benefits on several architectures and various applications such as image classification, patch matching, and two video classification datasets."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2qpBg9neUc,"We introduce a method for simultaneously classifying, segmenting and tracking object instances in a video sequence. Our method, named MaskProp, adapts the popular Mask R-CNN to video by adding a mask propagation branch that propagates frame-level object instance masks from each video frame to all the other frames in a video clip. This allows our system to predict clip-level instance tracks with respect to the object instances segmented in the middle frame of the clip. Clip-level instance tracks generated densely for each frame in the sequence are finally aggregated to produce video-level object instance segmentation and classification. Our experiments demonstrate that our clip-level instance segmentation makes our approach robust to motion blur and object occlusions in video. MaskProp achieves the best reported accuracy on the YouTube-VIS dataset, outperforming the ICCV 2019 video instance segmentation challenge winner despite being much simpler and using orders of magnitude less labeled data (1.3M vs 1B images and 860K vs 14M bounding boxes).

However, the disparity in smooth regions and detailed regions is still difficult to accurately estimate simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel stereo matching method called WaveletStereo, which learns the wavelet coefficients of the disparity rather than the disparity itself. The WaveletStereo consists of several sub-modules, where the low-frequency sub-module generates the low-frequency wavelet coefficients, which aims at learning global context information and well handling the low-frequency regions such as textureless surfaces, and the others focus on the details. In addition, a densely connected atrous spatial pyramid block is introduced for better learning the multi-scale image features. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale test dataset Scene Flow."

To resolve this, the success of Neural Archi-tecture Search (NAS) inspires us to search face-appropriate backbone and featrue pyramid network (FPN) architecture.Firstly, we design the search space for backbone and FPN by comparing performance of feature maps with different backbones and excellent FPN architectures on the face detection.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXYzi-ATzRE,"Recent advances in 3D sensing have created unique challenges for computer vision. One fundamental challenge is finding a good representation for 3D sensor data. Most popular representations (such as PointNet) are proposed in the context of processing truly 3D data (e.g. points sampled from mesh models), ignoring the fact that 3D sensored data such as a LiDAR sweep is in fact 2.5D. We argue that representing 2.5D data as collections of (x,y,z) points fundamentally destroys hidden information about freespace. In this paper, we demonstrate such knowledge can be efficiently recovered through 3D raycasting and readily incorporated into batch-based gradient learning. We describe a simple approach to augmenting voxel-based networks with visibility: we add a voxelized visibility map as an additional input stream. In addition, we show that visibility can be combined with two crucial modifications common to state-of-the-art 3D detectors: synthetic data augmentation of virtual objects and temporal aggregation of LiDAR sweeps over multiple time frames. On the NuScenes 3D detection benchmark, we show that, by adding an additional stream for visibility input, we can significantly improve the overall detection accuracy of a state-of-the-art 3D detector."

Our focus is on neuroscience model organisms, to be able to study how neural circuits orchestrate behaviour. Human pose estimation attains remarkable accuracy when trained on real or simulated datasets consisting of millions of frames. However, for many applications simulated models are unrealistic and real training datasets with comprehensive annotations do not exist. We address this problem with a new sim2real domain transfer method. Our key contribution is the explicit and independent modeling of appearance, shape and pose in an unpaired image translation framework. Our model lets us train a pose estimator on the target domain by transferring readily available body keypoint locations from the source domain to generated target images. We compare our approach with existing domain transfer methods and demonstrate improved pose estimation accuracy on Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Caenorhabditis elegans (worm) and Danio rerio (zebrafish), without requiring any manual annotation on the target domain and despite using simplistic off-the-shelf animal characters for simulation, or simple geometric shapes as models.

Thus training a robust recognition model requires a large amount of data to cover diversity as much as possible. In contrast to data collection and annotation, data augmentation is a low cost way. In this paper, we propose a new method for text image augmentation. Different from traditional augmentation methods such as rotation, scaling and perspective transformation, our proposed augmentation method is designed to learn proper and efficient data augmentation which is more effective and specific for training a robust recognizer. By using a set of custom fiducial points, the proposed augmentation method is flexible and controllable. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between the isolated processes of data augmentation and network optimization by joint learning. An agent network learns from the output of the recognition network and controls the fiducial points to generate more proper training samples for the recognition network. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including regular scene text, irregular scene text and handwritten text, show that the proposed augmentation and the joint learning methods significantly boost the performance of the recognition networks. A general toolkit for geometric augmentation is available."

The success of existing approaches is attributed to deep network design and large amount of labelled training data, where the latter is assumed to be always available. However, obtaining 3d point cloud segmentation labels is often very costly in practice. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised point cloud segmentation approach which requires only a tiny fraction of points to be labelled in the training stage. This is made possible by learning gradient approximation and exploitation of additional spatial and color smoothness constraints. Experiments are done on three public datasets with different degrees of weak supervision. In particular, our proposed method can produce results that are close to and sometimes even better than its fully supervised counterpart with 10X fewer labels."

The state-of-the-art approaches ""Decoupling"" and ""Co-teaching+"" claim that the ""disagreement"" strategy is crucial for alleviating the problem of learning with noisy labels. In this paper, we start from a different perspective and propose a robust learning paradigm called JoCoR, which aims to reduce the diversity of two networks during training. Specifically, we first use two networks to make predictions on the same mini-batch data and calculate a joint loss with Co-Regularization for each training example. Then we select small-loss examples to update the parameters of both two networks simultaneously. Trained by the joint loss, these two networks would be more and more similar due to the effect of Co-Regularization. Extensive experimental results on corrupted data from benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M demonstrate that JoCoR is superior to many state-of-the-art approaches for learning with noisy labels."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XZeNOOzAFQ,"Scene text detection has witnessed rapid development in recent years. However, there still exists two main challenges: 1) many methods suffer from false positives in their text representations; 2) the large scale variance of scene texts makes it hard for network to learn samples. In this paper, we propose the ContourNet, which effectively handles these two problems taking a further step toward accurate arbitrary-shaped text detection. At first, a scale-insensitive Adaptive Region Proposal Network (Adaptive-RPN) is proposed to generate text proposals by only focusing on the Intersection over Union (IoU) values between predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes. Then a novel Local Orthogonal Texture-aware Module (LOTM) models the local texture information of proposal features in two orthogonal directions and represents text region with a set of contour points. Considering that the strong unidirectional or weakly orthogonal activation is usually caused by the monotonous texture characteristic of false-positive patterns (e.g. streaks.), our method effectively suppresses these false positives by only outputting predictions with high response value in both orthogonal directions. This gives more accurate description of text regions. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets (Total-Text, CTW1500 and ICDAR2015) verify that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

However, this was often achieved at the cost of increased complexity, raising concerns about the interpretability and the reliability of deep networks. Recently, an increasing attention has been given to untangling the complexity of deep networks and quantifying their uncertainty for different computer vision tasks. Differently, the task of depth completion has not received enough attention despite the inherent noisy nature of depth sensors. In this work, we thus focus on modeling the uncertainty of depth data in depth completion starting from the sparse noisy input all the way to the final prediction. We propose a novel approach to identify disturbed measurements in the input by learning an input confidence estimator in a self-supervised manner based on the normalized convolutional neural networks (NCNNs). Further, we propose a probabilistic version of NCNNs that produces a statistically meaningful uncertainty measure for the final prediction. When we evaluate our approach on the KITTI dataset for depth completion, we outperform all the existing Bayesian Deep Learning approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, quality of the uncertainty measure, and the computational efficiency. Moreover, our small network with 670k parameters performs on-par with conventional approaches with millions of parameters. These results give strong evidence that separating the network into parallel uncertainty and prediction streams leads to state-of-the-art performance with accurate uncertainty estimates."

In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis on the underperformance of state-of-the-art models in front of long-tail distribution. We find existing detection methods are unable to model few-shot classes when the dataset is extremely skewed, which can result in classifier imbalance in terms of parameter magnitude. Directly adapting long-tail classification models to detection frameworks can not solve this problem due to the intrinsic difference between detection and classification. In this work, we propose a novel balanced group softmax (BAGS) module for balancing the classifiers within the detection frameworks through group-wise training. It implicitly modulates the training process for the head and tail classes and ensures they are both sufficiently trained, without requiring any extra sampling for the instances from the tail classes. Extensive experiments on the very recent long-tail large vocabulary object recognition benchmark LVIS show that our proposed BAGS significantly improves the performance of detectors with various backbones and frameworks on both object detection and instance segmentation.

To address single-image RGB localization, state-of-the-art feature-based methods match local descriptors between a query image and a pre-built 3D model. Recently, deep neural networks have been exploited to regress the mapping between raw pixels and 3D coordinates in the scene, and thus the matching is implicitly performed by the forward pass through the network. However, in a large and ambiguous environment, learning such a regression task directly can be difficult for a single network. In this work, we present a new hierarchical scene coordinate network to predict pixel scene coordinates in a coarse-to-fine manner from a single RGB image. The network consists of a series of output layers, each of them conditioned on the previous ones. The final output layer predicts the 3D coordinates and the others produce progressively finer discrete location labels. The proposed method outperforms the baseline regression-only network and allows us to train compact models which scale robustly to large environments. It sets a new state-of-the-art for single-image RGB localization performance on the 7-Scenes, 12-Scenes, Cambridge Landmarks datasets, and three combined scenes. Moreover, for large-scale outdoor localization on the Aachen Day-Night dataset, we present a hybrid approach which outperforms existing scene coordinate regression methods, and reduces significantly the performance gap w.r.t. explicit feature matching methods."

Actually, STR is an application highly related to security issues. However, there are few studies considering the safety and reliability of STR models that make sequential prediction. In this paper, we make the first attempt in attacking the state-of-the-art DNN-based STR models. Specifically, we propose a novel and efficient optimization-based method that can be naturally integrated to different sequential prediction schemes, i.e., connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention mechanism. We apply our proposed method to five state-of-the-art STR models with both targeted and untargeted attack modes, the comprehensive results on 7 real-world datasets and 2 synthetic datasets consistently show the vulnerability of these STR models with a significant performance drop.

Yet, the relevance between sequence prediction and imputation is disregarded by existing approaches. To this end, we propose a novel imitative non-autoregressive modeling method to simultaneously handle the trajectory prediction task and the missing value imputation task. Specifically, our framework adopts an imitation learning paradigm, which contains a recurrent conditional variational autoencoder (RC-VAE) as a demonstrator, and a non-autoregressive transformation model (NART) as a learner. By jointly optimizing the two models, RC-VAE can predict the future trajectory and capture the temporal relationship in the sequence to supervise the NART learner. As a result, NART learns from the demonstrator and imputes the missing value in a non autoregressive strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular datasets, and the results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets."

Compared to traditional person re-identification that handles only the intra-modality discrepancy, VI-ReID suffers from additional cross-modality discrepancy caused by different types of imaging systems. To reduce both intra- and cross-modality discrepancies, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modality Disentanglement (Hi-CMD) method, which automatically disentangles ID-discriminative factors and ID-excluded factors from visible-thermal images. We only use ID-discriminative factors for robust cross-modality matching without ID-excluded factors such as pose or illumination. To implement our approach, we introduce an ID-preserving person image generation network and a hierarchical feature learning module. Our generation network learns the disentangled representation by generating a new cross-modality image with different poses and illuminations while preserving a person's identity. At the same time, the feature learning module enables our model to explicitly extract the common ID-discriminative characteristic between visible-infrared images.

The ASG is a directed graph consisting of three types of abstract nodes (object, attribute, relationship) grounded in the image without any concrete semantic labels. Thus it is easy to obtain either manually or automatically. From the ASG, we propose a novel ASG2Caption model, which is able to recognise user intentions and semantics in the graph, and therefore generate desired captions following the graph structure.

Most of advanced solutions exploit class activation map (CAM). However, CAMs can hardly serve as the object mask due to the gap between full and weak supervisions. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised equivariant attention mechanism (SEAM) to discover additional supervision and narrow the gap. Our method is based on the observation that equivariance is an implicit constraint in fully supervised semantic segmentation, whose pixel-level labels take the same spatial transformation as the input images during data augmentation. However, this constraint is lost on the CAMs trained by image-level supervision. Therefore, we propose consistency regularization on predicted CAMs from various transformed images to provide self-supervision for network learning. Moreover, we propose a pixel correlation module (PCM), which exploits context appearance information and refines the prediction of current pixel by its similar neighbors, leading to further improvement on CAMs consistency.

Due to the rare occurrence of anomalies, optimizing such networks can be a cumbersome task. Another possible approach is to use both generator and discriminator for anomaly detection. However, attributed to the involvement of adversarial training, this model is often unstable in a way that the performance fluctuates drastically with each training step. In this study, we propose a framework that effectively generates stable results across a wide range of training steps and allows us to use both the generator and the discriminator of an adversarial model for efficient and robust anomaly detection. Our approach transforms the fundamental role of a discriminator from identifying real and fake data to distinguishing between good and bad quality reconstructions. To this end, we prepare training examples for the good quality reconstruction by employing the current generator, whereas poor quality examples are obtained by utilizing an old state of the same generator. This way, the discriminator learns to detect subtle distortions that often appear in reconstructions of the anomaly inputs.

To bridge the gap, we propose a new dataset for visual reasoning in context of referring expression comprehension with two main features. First, we design a novel expression engine rendering various reasoning logics that can be flexibly combined with rich visual properties to generate expressions with varying compositionality. Second, to better exploit the full reasoning chain embodied in an expression, we propose a new test setting by adding additional distracting images containing objects sharing similar properties with the referent, thus minimising the success rate of reasoning-free cross-domain alignment.

We evaluate the performance of RF-ReID on longitudinal datasets that span days and weeks, where the person may wear different clothes across days. Our experiments demonstrate that RF-ReID outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-based ReID approaches for long term person ReID. Our results also reveal two interesting features: First since RF signals work in the presence of occlusions and poor lighting, RF-ReID allows for person ReID in such scenarios.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBxguUF3XAQ,"Many problems in computer vision require dealing with sparse, unordered data in the form of point clouds. Permutation-equivariant networks have become a popular solution - they operate on individual data points with simple perceptrons and extract contextual information with global pooling. This can be achieved with a simple normalization of the feature maps, a global operation that is unaffected by the order. In this paper, we propose Attentive Context Normalization (ACN), a simple yet effective technique to build permutation-equivariant networks robust to outliers. Specifically, we show how to normalize the feature maps with weights that are estimated within the network, excluding outliers from this normalization. We use this mechanism to leverage two types of attention: local and global - by combining them, our method is able to find the essential data points in high-dimensional space in order to solve a given task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach, which we call Attentive Context Networks (ACNe), provides a significant leap in performance compared to the state-of-the-art on camera pose estimation, robust fitting, and point cloud classification under noise and outliers.

The six-point minimal solver for the GEM has poor numerical stability and applies only for a minimal number of points. Existing non-minimal solvers for GEM estimation rely on either local optimization or relinearization techniques, which impedes high accuracy in common scenarios. Our proposed non-minimal solver minimizes the sum of squared residuals by reformulating the problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. The globally optimal solution is thus obtained by a semidefinite relaxation. The algorithm retrieves certifiably globally optimal solutions to the original non-convex problem in polynomial time. We also provide the necessary and sufficient conditions to recover the optimal GEM from the relaxed problems. The improved performance is demonstrated over experiments on both synthetic and real multi-camera systems."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LngdGKDKR3Q,"We address weakly-supervised video actor-action segmentation (VAAS), which extends general video object segmentation (VOS) to additionally consider action labels of the actors. The most successful methods on VOS synthesize a pool of pseudo-annotations (PAs) and then refine them iteratively. However, they face challenges as to how to select from a massive amount of PAs high-quality ones, how to set an appropriate stop condition for weakly-supervised training, and how to initialize PAs pertaining to VAAS. To overcome these challenges, we propose a general Weakly-Supervised framework with a Wise Selection of training samples and model evaluation criterion (WS^2). Instead of blindly trusting quality-inconsistent PAs, WS^2 employs a learning-based selection to select effective PAs and a novel region integrity criterion as a stopping condition for weakly-supervised training. In addition, a 3D-Conv GCAM is devised to adapt to the VAAS task. Extensive experiments show that WS^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both weakly-supervised VOS and VAAS tasks and is on par with the best fully-supervised method on VAAS."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nCg_z0yqj0,"Referring expression comprehension (REC) and segmentation (RES) are two highly-related tasks, which both aim at identifying the referent according to a natural language expression. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-task Collaborative Network (MCN) to achieve a joint learning of REC and RES for the first time. In MCN, RES can help REC to achieve better language-vision alignment, while REC can help RES to better locate the referent. In addition, we address a key challenge in this multi-task setup, i.e., the prediction conflict, with two innovative designs namely, Consistency Energy Maximization (CEM) and Adaptive Soft Non-Located Suppression (ASNLS). Specifically, CEM enables REC and RES to focus on similar visual regions by maximizing the consistency energy between two tasks. ASNLS supresses the response of unrelated regions in RES based on the prediction of REC. To validate our model, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of REC and RES, i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg. The experimental results report the significant performance gains of MCN over all existing methods, i.e., up to +7.13% for REC and +11.50% for RES over SOTA, which well confirm the validity of our model for joint REC and RES learning."

In this work, we solve the hand segmentation generalization problem without requiring segmentation labels in the target domain. To this end, we propose a Bayesian CNN-based model adaptation framework for hand segmentation, which introduces and considers two key factors: 1) prediction uncertainty when the model is applied in a new domain and 2) common information about hand shapes shared across domains. Consequently, we propose an iterative self-training method for hand segmentation in the new domain, which is guided by the model uncertainty estimated by a Bayesian CNN. We further use an adversarial component in our framework to utilize shared information about hand shapes to constrain the model adaptation process. Experiments on multiple egocentric datasets show that the proposed method significantly improves the generalization performance of hand segmentation."

Like other flow models, HCNAF performs exact likelihood inference. We conduct a number of density estimation tasks on toy experiments and MNIST to demonstrate the effectiveness and attributes of HCNAF, including its generalization capability over unseen conditions and expressivity.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYhP4lXQyQQ,"Background models are widely used in computer vision. While successful Static-camera Background (SCB) models exist, Moving-camera Background (MCB) models are limited. Seemingly, there is a straightforward solution: 1) align the video frames; 2) learn an SCB model; 3) warp either original or previously-unseen frames toward the model. This approach, however, has drawbacks, especially when the accumulative camera motion is large and/or the video is long. Here we propose a purely-2D unsupervised modular method that systematically eliminates those issues. First, to estimate warps in the original video, we solve a joint-alignment problem while leveraging a certifiably-correct initialization. Next, we learn both multiple partially-overlapping local subspaces and how to predict alignments. Lastly, in test time, we warp a previously-unseen frame, based on the prediction, and project it on a subset of those subspaces to obtain a background/foreground separation. We show the method handles even large scenes with a relatively-free camera motion (provided the camera-to-scene distance does not change much) and that it not only yields State-of-the-Art results on the original video but also generalizes gracefully to previously-unseen videos of the same scene.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK6PfOVLLnM,"Neural architecture search (NAS) has dramatically advanced the development of neural network design. We revisit the search space design in most previous NAS methods and find the number and widths of blocks are set manually. However, block counts and block widths determine the network scale (depth and width) and make a great influence on both the accuracy and the model cost (FLOPs/latency). In this paper, we propose to search block counts and block widths by designing a densely connected search space, i.e., DenseNAS. The new search space is represented as a dense super network, which is built upon our designed routing blocks. In the super network, routing blocks are densely connected and we search for the best path between them to derive the final architecture. We further propose a chained cost estimation algorithm to approximate the model cost during the search. Both the accuracy and model cost are optimized in DenseNAS. For experiments on the MobileNetV2-based search space, DenseNAS achieves 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 361MB FLOPs and 17.9ms latency on a single TITAN-XP. The larger model searched by DenseNAS achieves 76.1% accuracy with only 479M FLOPs. DenseNAS further promotes the ImageNet classification accuracies of ResNet-18, -34 and -50-B by 1.5%, 0.5% and 0.3% with 200M, 600M and 680M FLOPs reduction respectively.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQO0Lpd65Y,"Deep neural networks have attained remarkable performance when applied to data that comes from the same distribution as that of the training set, but can significantly degrade otherwise. Therefore, detecting whether an example is out-of-distribution (OoD) is crucial to enable a system that can reject such samples or alert users. Recent works have made significant progress on OoD benchmarks consisting of small image datasets. However, many recent methods based on neural networks rely on training or tuning with both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. The latter is generally hard to define a-priori, and its selection can easily bias the learning. We base our work on a popular method ODIN, proposing two strategies for freeing it from the needs of tuning with OoD data, while improving its OoD detection performance. We specifically propose to decompose confidence scoring as well as a modified input pre-processing method. We show that both of these significantly help in detection performance. Our further analysis on a larger scale image dataset shows that the two types of distribution shifts, specifically semantic shift and non-semantic shift, present a significant difference in the difficulty of the problem, providing an analysis of when ODIN-like strategies do or do not work."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLOb8qwB54U,"In spite of the overwhelming high-tech marvels and applications that rule our digital lives, the use of the handwritten signature is still recognized worldwide in government, personal and legal entities to be the most important behavioral biometric trait. A number of notable research approaches provide advanced results up to a certain point which allow us to assert with confidence that the performance attained by signature verification (SV) systems is comparable to those provided by any other biometric modality. Up to now, the mainstream trend for offline SV is shared between standard -or handcrafted- feature extraction methods and popular machine learning techniques, with typical examples ranging from sparse representation to Deep Learning. Recent progress in graph mining algorithms provide us with the prospect to re-evaluate the opportunity of utilizing graph representations by exploring corresponding graph features for offline SV. In this paper, inspired by the recent use of image visibility graphs for mapping images into networks, we introduce for the first time in offline SV literature their use as a parameter free, agnostic representation for exploring global as well as local information. Global properties of the sparsely located content of the shape of the signature image are encoded with topological information of the whole graph. In addition, local pixel patches are encoded by sequential visibility motifs-subgraphs of size four, to a low six dimensional motif profile vector. A number of pooling functions operate on the motif codes in a spatial pyramid context in order to create the final feature vector. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated with the use of two popular datasets. The local visibility graph features are considered to be highly informative for SV; this is sustained by the corresponding results which are at least comparable with other classic state-of-the-art approaches."

In this work, we propose an efficient deep model, called MotionNet, to jointly perform perception and motion prediction from 3D point clouds. MotionNet takes a sequence of LiDAR sweeps as input and outputs a bird's eye view (BEV) map, which encodes the object category and motion information in each grid cell. The backbone of MotionNet is a novel spatio-temporal pyramid network, which extracts deep spatial and temporal features in a hierarchical fashion. To enforce the smoothness of predictions over both space and time, the training of MotionNet is further regularized with novel spatial and temporal consistency losses. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method overall outperforms the state-of-the-arts, including the latest scene-flow- and 3D-object-detection-based methods. This indicates the potential value of the proposed method serving as a backup to the bounding-box-based system, and providing complementary information to the motion planner in autonomous driving.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ZUZYy_GtY,"In this paper, we address the few-shot classification task from a new perspective of optimal matching between image regions. We adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as a metric to compute a structural distance between dense image representations to determine image relevance. The EMD generates the optimal matching flows between structural elements that have the minimum matching cost, which is used to represent the image distance for classification. To generate the important weights of elements in the EMD formulation, we design a cross-reference mechanism, which can effectively minimize the impact caused by the cluttered background and large intra-class appearance variations. To handle k-shot classification, we propose to learn a structured fully connected layer that can directly classify dense image representations with the EMD. Based on the implicit function theorem, the EMD can be inserted as a layer into the network for end-to-end training. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate our algorithm and we set new state-of-the-art performance on four popular few-shot classification benchmarks, namely miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, Fewshot-CIFAR100 (FC100) and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB)."

The proposed solution produces high-quality images even in the zero-shot setting and allows for more freedom in changes to the content geometry. This is made possible by introducing a novel Two-Stage Peer-Regularization Layer that recombines style and content in latent space by means of a custom graph convolutional layer. Contrary to the vast majority of existing solutions, our model does not depend on any pre-trained networks for computing perceptual losses and can be trained fully end-to-end thanks to a new set of cyclic losses that operate directly in latent space and not on the RGB images. An extensive ablation study confirms the usefulness of the proposed losses and of the Two-Stage Peer-Regularization Layer, with qualitative results that are competitive with respect to the current state of the art using a single model for all presented styles. This opens the door to more abstract and artistic neural image generation scenarios, along with simpler deployment of the model."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se9IbnH6e7c,"Deep neural networks have made tremendous progress in 3D point-cloud recognition. Recent works have shown that these 3D recognition networks are also vulnerable to adversarial samples produced from various attack methods, including optimization-based 3D Carlini-Wagner attack, gradient-based iterative fast gradient method, and skeleton-detach based point-dropping. However, after a careful analysis, these methods are either extremely slow because of the optimization/iterative scheme, or not flexible to support targeted attack of a specific category. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel label guided adversarial network (LG-GAN) for real-time flexible targeted point cloud attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generation based 3D point cloud attack method. By feeding the original point clouds and target attack label into LG-GAN, it can learn how to deform the point clouds to mislead the recognition network into the specific label only with a single forward pass. In detail, LG-GAN first leverages one multi-branch adversarial network to extract hierarchical features of the input point clouds, then incorporates the specified label information into multiple intermediate features using the label encoder. Finally, the encoded features will be fed into the coordinate reconstruction decoder to generate the target adversarial sample. By evaluating different point-cloud recognition models (e.g., PointNet, PointNet++ and DGCNN), we demonstrate that the proposed LG-GAN can support flexible targeted attack on the fly while guaranteeing good attack performance and higher efficiency simultaneously."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVrRZs91Jqc,"Existing gait recognition approaches typically focus on learning identity features that are invariant to covariates (e.g., the carrying status, clothing, walking speed, and viewing angle) and seldom involve learning features from the covariate aspect, which may lead to failure modes when variations due to the covariate overwhelm those due to the identity. We therefore propose a method of gait recognition via disentangled representation learning that considers both identity and covariate features. Specifically, we first encode an input gait template to get the disentangled identity and covariate features, and then decode the features to simultaneously reconstruct the input gait template and the canonical version of the same subject with no covariates in a semi-supervised manner to ensure successful disentanglement. We finally feed the disentangled identity features into a contrastive/triplet loss function for a verification/identification task. Moreover, we find that new gait templates can be synthesized by transferring the covariate feature from one subject to another. Experimental results on three publicly available gait data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art methods."

Since GPs are fully determined by their mean and covariance functions, we are able to obtain predictive uncertainty estimates at the cost of a single forward pass through any chosen CNN architecture and for any supervised learning task. By leveraging the structure of the induced covariance matrices, we propose numerically efficient algorithms which enable fast training in the context of high-dimensional tasks such as depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions for constructing regression loss functions whose probabilistic counterparts are compatible with aleatoric uncertainty quantification."

Our key insight is to leverage interactions with another person---whose body pose we can directly observe---as a signal inherently linked to the body pose of the first-person subject. We show that since interactions between individuals often induce a well-ordered series of back-and-forth responses, it is possible to learn a temporal model of the interlinked poses even though one party is largely out of view. We demonstrate our idea on a variety of domains with dyadic interaction and show the substantial impact on egocentric body pose estimation, which improves the state of the art."

Although existing optical flow based methods have achieved promising results, they still face great challenges in dealing with the interpolation of complicated dynamic scenes, which include occlusion, blur or abrupt brightness change. This is mainly because these cases may break the basic assumptions of the optical flow estimation (i.e. smoothness, consistency). In this work, we devised a novel structure-to-texture generation framework which splits the video interpolation task into two stages: structure-guided interpolation and texture refinement. In the first stage, deep structure-aware features are employed to predict feature flows from two consecutive frames to their intermediate result, and further generate the structure image of the intermediate frame. In the second stage, based on the generated coarse result, a Frame Texture Compensator is trained to fill in detailed textures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that attempts to directly generate the intermediate frame through blending deep features.

However, existing approaches for TextVQA are mostly based on custom pairwise fusion mechanisms between a pair of two modalities and are restricted to a single prediction step by casting TextVQA as a classification task. In this work, we propose a novel model for the TextVQA task based on a multimodal transformer architecture accompanied by a rich representation for text in images. Our model naturally fuses different modalities homogeneously by embedding them into a common semantic space where self-attention is applied to model inter- and intra- modality context. Furthermore, it enables iterative answer decoding with a dynamic pointer network, allowing the model to form an answer through multi-step prediction instead of one-step classification.

The modality required for temporal localization may be different from that for answer prediction, and this ability to shift modality is essential for performing the task. To this end, MSAN is based on (1) the moment proposal network (MPN) that attempts to locate the most appropriate temporal moment from each of the modalities, and also on (2) the heterogeneous reasoning network (HRN) that predicts the answer using an attention mechanism on both modalities.

Our experimental results show that deep learning approaches, such as Faster R-CNN, are not robust at object detection under occlusion. Compositional convolutional neural networks (CompositionalNets) have been shown to be robust at classifying occluded objects by explicitly representing the object as a composition of parts. In this work, we propose to overcome two limitations of CompositionalNets which will enable them to detect partially occluded objects: 1) CompositionalNets, as well as other DCNN architectures, do not explicitly separate the representation of the context from the object itself. Under strong object occlusion, the influence of the context is amplified which can have severe negative effects for detection at test time. In order to overcome this, we propose to segment the context during training via bounding box annotations. We then use the segmentation to learn a context-aware compositionalNet that disentangles the representation of the context and the object. 2) We extend the part-based voting scheme in CompositionalNets to vote for the corners of the object's bounding box, which enables the model to reliably estimate bounding boxes for partially occluded objects. Our extensive experiments show that our proposed model can detect objects robustly, increasing the detection performance of strongly occluded vehicles from PASCAL3D+ and MS-COCO by 41% and 35% respectively in absolute performance relative to Faster R-CNN."

We propose MnasFPN, a mobile-friendly search space for the detection head, and combine it with latency-aware architecture search to produce efficient object detection models. The learned MnasFPN head, when paired with MobileNetV2 body, outperforms MobileNetV3+SSDLite by 1.8 mAP at similar latency on Pixel. It is both 1 mAP more accurate and 10% faster than NAS-FPNLite. Ablation studies show that the majority of the performance gain comes from innovations in the search space. Further explorations reveal an interesting coupling between the search space design and the search algorithm, for which the complexity of MnasFPN search space is opportune."

This does not account for the fact that objects in a 2D space are a projection of 3D ones, and thus they have limited ability to severe object viewpoint changes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable module, cylindrical convolutional networks (CCNs), that exploit cylindrical representation of a convolutional kernel defined in the 3D space. CCNs extract a view-specific feature through a view-specific convolutional kernel to predict object category scores at each viewpoint. With the view-specific feature, we simultaneously determine objective category and viewpoints using the proposed sinusoidal soft-argmax module. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the cylindrical convolutional networks on joint object detection and viewpoint estimation."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumJdoZlEQQ,"The rapid increase in the amount of published visual data and the limited time of users bring the demand for processing untrimmed videos to produce shorter versions that convey the same information. Despite the remarkable progress that has been made by summarization methods, most of them can only select a few frames or skims, which creates visual gaps and breaks the video context. In this paper, we present a novel methodology based on a reinforcement learning formulation to accelerate instructional videos. Our approach can adaptively select frames that are not relevant to convey the information without creating gaps in the final video. Our agent is textually and visually oriented to select which frames to remove to shrink the input video. Additionally, we propose a novel network, called Visually-guided Document Attention Network (VDAN), able to generate a highly discriminative embedding space to represent both textual and visual data. Our experiments show that our method achieves the best performance in terms of F1 Score and coverage at the video segment level."

However, the images of different fine-grained objects tend to merely exhibit subtle differences in appearance, which will severely deteriorate zero-shot object recognition. To reduce the superfluous information in the fine-grained objects, in this paper, we propose to learn the redundancy-free features for generalized zero-shot learning. We achieve our motivation by projecting the original visual features into a new (redundancy-free) feature space and then restricting the statistical dependence between these two feature spaces. Furthermore, we require the projected features to keep and even strengthen the category relationship in the redundancy-free feature space. In this way, we can remove the redundant information from the visual features without losing the discriminative information. We extensively evaluate the performance on four benchmark datasets. The results show that our redundancy-free feature based generalized zero-shot learning (RFF-GZSL) approach can outperform the state-of-the-arts often by a large margin."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhekowXS3r4,"Weakly supervised learning has emerged as a compelling tool for object detection by reducing the need for strong supervision during training. However, major challenges remain: (1) differentiation of object instances can be ambiguous; (2) detectors tend to focus on discriminative parts rather than entire objects; (3) without ground truth, object proposals have to be redundant for high recalls, causing significant memory consumption. Addressing these challenges is difficult, as it often requires to eliminate uncertainties and trivial solutions. To target these issues we develop an instance-aware and context-focused unified framework. It employs an instance-aware self-training algorithm and a learnable Concrete DropBlock while devising a memory-efficient sequential batch back-propagation. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO (12.1% AP, 24.8% AP50), VOC 2007 (54.9% AP), and VOC 2012 (52.1% AP), improving baselines by great margins.

State-of-the-art approaches prove that performing semantic-level alignment is helpful in tackling the domain shift issue. Based on the observation that stuff categories usually share similar appearances across images of different domains while things (i.e. object instances) have much larger differences, we propose to improve the semantic-level alignment with different strategies for stuff regions and for things: 1) for the stuff categories, we generate feature representation for each class and conduct the alignment operation from the target domain to the source domain; 2) for the thing categories, we generate feature representation for each individual instance and encourage the instance in the target domain to align with the most similar one in the source domain. In this way, the individual differences within thing categories will also be considered to alleviate over-alignment. In addition to our proposed method, we further reveal the reason why the current adversarial loss is often unstable in minimizing the distribution discrepancy and show that our method can help ease this issue by minimizing the most similar stuff and instance features between the source and the target domains. We conduct extensive experiments in two unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, i.e. GTA5 - Cityscapes and SYNTHIA - Cityscapes, and achieve the new state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnslISMQBlQ,"In this paper, we propose a novel system named Disp R-CNN for 3D object detection from stereo images. Many recent works solve this problem by first recovering a point cloud with disparity estimation and then apply a 3D detector. The disparity map is computed for the entire image, which is costly and fails to leverage category-specific prior. In contrast, we design an instance disparity estimation network (iDispNet) that predicts disparity only for pixels on objects of interest and learns a category-specific shape prior for more accurate disparity estimation. To address the challenge from scarcity of disparity annotation in training, we propose to use a statistical shape model to generate dense disparity pseudo-ground-truth without the need of LiDAR point clouds, which makes our system more widely applicable. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that, even when LiDAR ground-truth is not available at training time, Disp R-CNN achieves competitive performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 20% in terms of average precision.

In order to determine the contribution/importance of a spatial-temporal feature node, we propose to learn the attention from a global view with convolutional operations. Specifically, we stack its relations, i.e.no, pairwise correlations with respect to a representative set of reference feature nodes (S-RFNs) that represents global video information, together with the feature itself to infer the attention. Moreover, to exploit the semantics of different levels, we propose to learn multi-granularity attentions based on the relations captured at different granularities. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our attentive feature aggregation module MG-RAFA. Our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBWlJ0xHLa8,"Most of the existing approaches for person re-identification consider a static setting where the number of cameras in the network is fixed. An interesting direction, which has received little attention, is to explore the dynamic nature of a camera network, where one tries to adapt the existing re-identification models after on-boarding new cameras, with little additional effort. There have been a few recent methods proposed in person re-identification that attempt to address this problem by assuming the labeled data in the existing network is still available while adding new cameras. This is a strong assumption since there may exist some privacy issues for which one may not have access to those data. Rather, based on the fact that it is easy to store the learned re-identifications models, which mitigates any data privacy concern, we develop an efficient model adaptation approach using hypothesis transfer learning that aims to transfer the knowledge using only source models and limited labeled data, but without using any source camera data from the existing network. Our approach minimizes the effect of negative transfer by finding an optimal weighted combination of multiple source models for transferring the knowledge. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets with variable number of cameras well demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ca4xvfAZbs,"A wide variety of works have explored the reason for the existence of adversarial examples, but there is no consensus on the explanation. We propose to treat the DNN logits as a vector for feature representation, and exploit them to analyze the mutual influence of two independent inputs based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). We utilize this vector representation to understand adversarial examples by disentangling the clean images and adversarial perturbations, and analyze their influence on each other. Our results suggest a new perspective towards the relationship between images and universal perturbations: Universal perturbations contain dominant features, and images behave like noise to them. This feature perspective leads to a new method for generating targeted universal adversarial perturbations using random source images. We are the first to achieve the challenging task of a targeted universal attack without utilizing original training data. Our approach using a proxy dataset achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art baselines which utilize the original training dataset."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsAqBi3QniA,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently attracted significant research interest as the third generation of artificial neural networks that can enable low-power event-driven data analytics. The best performing SNNs for image recognition tasks are obtained by converting a trained Analog Neural Network (ANN), consisting of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), to SNN composed of integrate-and-fire neurons with ""proper"" firing thresholds. The converted SNNs typically incur loss in accuracy compared to that provided by the original ANN and require sizable number of inference time-steps to achieve the best accuracy. We find that performance degradation in the converted SNN stems from using ""hard reset"" spiking neuron that is driven to fixed reset potential once its membrane potential exceeds the firing threshold, leading to information loss during SNN inference. We propose ANN-SNN conversion using ""soft reset"" spiking neuron model, referred to as Residual Membrane Potential (RMP) spiking neuron, which retains the ""residual"" membrane potential above threshold at the firing instants. We demonstrate near loss-less ANN-SNN conversion using RMP neurons for VGG-16, ResNet-20, and ResNet-34 SNNs on challenging datasets including CIFAR-10 (93.63% top-1), CIFAR-100 (70.93% top-1), and ImageNet (73.09% top-1 accuracy).

In this paper we develop a blind method that can train directly on unlabelled and potentially forged images to point out local mosaic inconsistencies. To this aim we designed a CNN structure inspired from demosaicing algorithms and directed at classifying image blocks by their position in the image modulo (2 x 2). Creating a diversified benchmark database using varied demosaicing methods, we explore the efficiency of the method and its ability to adapt quickly to any new data."

This is achieved by using a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to bind the recognition and translation problems into a single unified architecture. This joint approach does not require any ground-truth timing information, simultaneously solving two co-dependant sequence-to-sequence learning problems and leads to significant performance gains. We evaluate the recognition and translation performances of our approaches on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) dataset. We report state-of-the-art sign language recognition and translation results achieved by our Sign Language Transformers. Our translation networks outperform both sign video to spoken language and gloss to spoken language translation models, in some cases more than doubling the performance (9.58 vs. 21.80 BLEU-4 Score).

The reason might be the subjectivity of human annotators and the ambiguous nature of the expression labels. One promising strategy tackling such a problem is a recently proposed learning paradigm called Label Distribution Learning (LDL), which allows multiple labels with different intensity to be linked to one expression. However, it is often impractical to directly apply label distribution learning because numerous existing datasets only contain one-hot labels rather than label distributions. To solve the problem, we propose a novel approach named Label Distribution Learning on Auxiliary Label Space Graphs(LDL-ALSG) that leverages the topological information of the labels from related but more distinct tasks, such as action unit recognition and facial landmark detection. The underlying assumption is that facial images should have similar expression distributions to their neighbours in the label space of action unit recognition and facial landmark detection.

As semantic boundary detection is the dual task of semantic segmentation, we introduce a loss function with boundary consistency constraint to improve the boundary pixel accuracy for semantic segmentation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art works, not only in semantic segmentation but also in semantic boundary detection. In particular, a mean IoU score of 81.8% on Cityscapes test set is achieved without using coarse data or any external data for semantic segmentation.

This paper introduces VectorNet, a hierarchical graph neural network that first exploits the spatial locality of individual road components represented by vectors and then models the high-order interactions among all components. In contrast to most recent approaches, which render trajectories of moving agents and road context information as bird-eye images and encode them with convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), our approach operates on the primitive vector representation. By operating on the vectorized high definition (HD) maps and agent trajectories, we avoid lossy rendering and computationally intensive ConvNet encoding steps. To further boost VectorNet's capability in learning context features, we propose a novel auxiliary task to recover the randomly masked out map entities and agent trajectories based on their context. We evaluate VectorNet on our in-house behavior prediction benchmark and the recently released Argoverse forecasting dataset.

To reduce the human labeling effort, we propose a novel webly supervised object detection (WebSOD) method for novel classes which only requires the web images without further annotations. Our proposed method combines bottom-up and top-down cues for novel class detection. Within our approach, we introduce a bottom-up mechanism based on the well-trained fully supervised object detector (i.e. Faster RCNN) as an object region estimator for web images by recognizing the common objectiveness shared by base and novel classes. With the estimated regions on the web images, we then utilize the top-down attention cues as the guidance for region classification. Furthermore, we propose a residual feature refinement (RFR) block to tackle the domain mismatch between web domain and the target domain. We demonstrate our proposed method on PASCAL VOC dataset with three different novel/base splits. Without any target-domain novel-class images and annotations, our proposed webly supervised object detection model is able to achieve promising performance for novel classes.

The encoder-decoder architectures are proposed to resolve this by applying a decoder network onto a backbone model designed for classification tasks. In this paper, we argue encoder-decoder architecture is ineffective in generating strong multi-scale features because of the scale-decreased backbone. We propose SpineNet, a backbone with scale-permuted intermediate features and cross-scale connections that is learned on an object detection task by Neural Architecture Search. Using similar building blocks, SpineNet models outperform ResNet-FPN models by 3%+ AP at various scales while using 10-20% fewer FLOPs.

Unfortunately, the existing results remain limited to networks with a couple of layers, and the practical viability of these results is not yet known. Motivated by some of these results, we explore the use of Hermite polynomial expansions as a substitute for ReLUs in deep networks. While our experiments with supervised learning do not provide a clear verdict, we find that this strategy offers considerable benefits in semi-supervised learning (SSL) / transductive learning settings. We carefully develop this idea and show how the use of Hermite polynomials based activations can yield improvements in pseudo-label accuracies and sizable financial savings (due to concurrent runtime benefits).

To remedy this, this paper proposes MiLeNAS, a mixed-level reformulation for NAS that can be optimized efficiently and reliably. It is shown that even when using a simple first-order method on the mixed-level formulation, MiLeNAS can achieve a lower validation error for NAS problems. Consequently, architectures obtained by our method achieve consistently higher accuracies than those obtained from bilevel optimization. Moreover, MiLeNAS proposes a framework beyond DARTS.

Existing NAS methods typically define different search spaces according to different tasks. In order to adapt to different task combinations (i.e., task sets), we disentangle the GP-MTL networks into single-task backbones (optionally encode the task priors), and a hierarchical and layerwise features sharing/fusing scheme across them. This enables us to design a novel and general task-agnostic search space, which inserts cross-task edges (i.e., feature fusion connections) into fixed single-task network backbones. Moreover, we also propose a novel single-shot gradient-based search algorithm that closes the performance gap between the searched architectures and the final evaluation architecture. This is realized with a minimum entropy regularization on the architecture weights during the search phase, which makes the architecture weights converge to near-discrete values and therefore achieves a single model. As a result, our searched model can be directly used for evaluation without (re-)training from scratch. We perform extensive experiments using different single-task backbones on various task sets, demonstrating the promising performance obtained by exploiting the hierarchical and layerwise features, as well as the desirable generalizability to different i) task sets and ii) single-task backbones.

Potential actions are then generated according to this distribution. For each potential action a distribution of the expected outcomes is calculated, and the value of the potential information gain assessed. The action taken is that which maximizes the potential information gain.

Predicting the same relationship across neighboring video segments is also inefficient. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel sliding-window scheme to simultaneously predict short-term and long-term relationships. We run windows with different kernel sizes on object tracklets to generate sub-tracklet proposals with different duration, while the computational load is similar to that in segment-based methods. To fully utilize spatial and temporal information in videos, we construct one spatial and one temporal graph and employ Graph Convloutional Network to generate contextual embedding for tracklet proposal compatibility evaluation.

In the literature, class re-balancing strategies (e.g., re-weighting and re-sampling) are the prominent and effective methods proposed to alleviate the extreme imbalance for dealing with long-tailed problems. In this paper, we firstly discover that these re-balancing methods achieving satisfactory recognition accuracy owe to that they could significantly promote the classifier learning of deep networks. However, at the same time, they will unexpectedly damage the representative ability of the learned deep features to some extent. Therefore, we propose a unified Bilateral-Branch Network (BBN) to take care of both representation learning and classifier learning simultaneously, where each branch does perform its own duty separately. In particular, our BBN model is further equipped with a novel cumulative learning strategy, which is designed to first learn the universal patterns and then pay attention to the tail data gradually. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, including the large-scale iNaturalist ones, justify that the proposed BBN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, validation experiments can demonstrate both our preliminary discovery and effectiveness of tailored designs in BBN for long-tailed problems.

To this end, we propose a House Plan Generative Model (HPGM) that first translates the language input to a structural graph representation and then predicts the layout of rooms with a Graph Conditioned Layout Prediction Network (GC-LPN) and generates the interior texture with a Language Conditioned Texture GAN (LCT-GAN). With some post-processing, the final product of this task is a 3D house model. To train and evaluate our model, we build the first Text--to--3D House Model dataset, which will be released at: https:// hidden-link-for-submission."

However, due to the domain gap between synthetic domain and real domain, it is challenging for a model trained with synthetic data to generalize to real data. In this paper, considering the fundamental difference between the two domains as the texture, we propose a method to adapt to the target domain's texture. First, we diversity the texture of synthetic images using a style transfer algorithm. The various textures of generated images prevent a segmentation model from overfitting to one specific (synthetic) texture. Then, we fine-tune the model with self-training to get direct supervision of the target texture. Our results achieve state-of-the-art performance and we analyze the properties of the model trained on the stylized dataset with extensive experiments."

One of the most popular research topics in this domain is Food Retrieval, due to its profound influence on health-oriented applications. In this paper, we focus on the task of cross-modal retrieval between food images and cooking recipes. We present Modality-Consistent Embedding Network (MCEN) that learns modality-invariant representations by projecting images and texts to the same embedding space. To capture the latent alignments between modalities, we incorporate stochastic latent variables to explicitly exploit the interactions between textual and visual features. Importantly, our method learns the cross-modal alignments during training but computes embeddings of different modalities independently at inference time for the sake of efficiency. Extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed MCEN outperforms all existing approaches on the benchmark Recipe1M dataset and requires less computational cost."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrNG6ZAyzR0,"Due to the advantages of real-time detection and improved performance, single-shot detectors have gained great attention recently. To solve the complex scale variations, single-shot detectors make scale-aware predictions based on multiple pyramid layers. However, the features in the pyramid are not scale-aware enough, which limits the detection performance. Two common problems in single-shot detectors caused by object scale variations can be observed: (1) small objects are easily missed; (2) the salient part of a large object is sometimes detected as an object. With this observation, we propose a new Neighbor Erasing and Transferring (NET) mechanism to reconfigure the pyramid features and explore scale-aware features. In NET, a Neighbor Erasing Module (NEM) is designed to erase the salient features of large objects and emphasize the features of small objects in shallow layers. A Neighbor Transferring Module (NTM) is introduced to transfer the erased features and highlight large objects in deep layers. With this mechanism, a single-shot network called NETNet is constructed for scale-aware object detection. In addition, we propose to aggregate nearest neighboring pyramid features to enhance our NET. NETNet achieves 38.5% AP at a speed of 27 FPS and 32.0% AP at a speed of 55 FPS on MS COCO dataset. As a result, NETNet achieves a better trade-off for real-time and accurate object detection."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qZLVPzEL1s,"Even as deep neural networks have become very effective for tasks in vision and perception, it remains difficult to explain and debug their behavior. In this paper, we present a programmatic and semantic approach to explaining, understanding, and debugging the correct and incorrect behaviors of a neural network based perception system. Our approach is semantic in that it employs a high-level representation of the distribution of environment scenarios that the detector is intended to work on. It is programmatic in that the representation is a program in a domain-specific probabilistic programming language using which synthetic data can be generated to train and test the neural network. We present a framework that assesses the performance of the neural network to identify correct and incorrect detections, extracts rules from those results that semantically characterizes the correct and incorrect scenarios, and then specializes the probabilistic program with those rules in order to more precisely characterize the scenarios in which the neural network operates correctly or not, without human intervention. We demonstrate our results using the Scenic probabilistic programming language and a neural network-based object detector. Our experiments show that it is possible to automatically generate compact rules that significantly increase the correct detection rate (or conversely the incorrect detection rate) of the network and can thus help with debugging and understanding its behavior."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipZ2AS1b0rI,"Recently, channel attention mechanism has demonstrated to offer great potential in improving the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most existing methods dedicate to developing more sophisticated attention modules for achieving better performance, which inevitably increase model complexity. To overcome the paradox of performance and complexity trade-off, this paper proposes an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module, which only involves a handful of parameters while bringing clear performance gain. By dissecting the channel attention module in SENet, we empirically show avoiding dimensionality reduction is important for learning channel attention, and appropriate cross-channel interaction can preserve performance while significantly decreasing model complexity. Therefore, we propose a local cross-channel interaction strategy without dimensionality reduction, which can be efficiently implemented via 1D convolution. Furthermore, we develop a method to adaptively select kernel size of 1D convolution, determining coverage of local cross-channel interaction. The proposed ECA module is both efficient and effective, e.g., the parameters and computations of our modules against backbone of ResNet50 are 80 vs. 24.37M and 4.7e-4 GFlops vs. 3.86 GFlops, respectively, and the performance boost is more than 2% in terms of Top-1 accuracy. We extensively evaluate our ECA module on image classification, object detection and instance segmentation with backbones of ResNets and MobileNetV2. The experimental results show our module is more efficient while performing favorably against its counterparts."

We observe that geometric estimators commonly focus more on feature preservation but are hard to tune parameters and sensitive to noise, while learning-based approaches pursue an overall normal estimation accuracy but cannot well handle challenging regions such as surface edges. This paper presents a novel normal estimation method, under the co-support of geometric estimator and deep learning. To lowering the learning difficulty, we first propose to compute a suboptimal initial normal at each point by searching for a best fitting patch. Based on the computed normal field, we design a normal-based height map network (NH-Net) to fine-tune the suboptimal normals. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the clear improvements of our results over both traditional methods and learning-based methods, in terms of estimation accuracy and feature recovery."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyKUD0QB_po,"One crucial aspect of partial domain adaptation (PDA) is how to select the relevant source samples in the shared classes for knowledge transfer. Previous PDA methods tackle this problem by re-weighting the source samples based on their high-level information (deep features). However, since the domain shift between source and target domains, only using the deep features for sample selection is defective. We argue that it is more reasonable to additionally exploit the pixel-level information for PDA problem, as the appearance difference between outlier source classes and target classes is significantly large. In this paper, we propose a reinforced transfer network (RTNet), which utilizes both high-level and pixel-level information for PDA problem. Our RTNet is composed of a reinforced data selector (RDS) based on reinforcement learning (RL), which filters out the outlier source samples, and a domain adaptation model which minimizes the domain discrepancy in the shared label space. Specifically, in the RDS, we design a novel reward based on the reconstruct errors of selected source samples on the target generator, which introduces the pixel-level information to guide the learning of RDS. Besides, we develope a state containing high-level information, which used by the RDS for sample selection. The proposed RDS is a general module, which can be easily integrated into existing DA models to make them fit the PDA situation. Extensive experiments indicate that RTNet can achieve state-of-the-art performance for PDA tasks on several benchmark datasets."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcFzjrodm50,"Text-to-image synthesis is a challenging task that generates realistic images from a textual sequence, which usually contains limited information compared with the corresponding image and so is ambiguous and abstractive. The limited textual information only describes a scene partly, which will complicate the generation with complementing the other details implicitly and lead to low-quality images. To address this problem, we propose a novel rich feature generating text-to-image synthesis, called RiFeGAN, to enrich the given description. In order to provide additional visual details and avoid conflicting, RiFeGAN exploits an attention-based caption matching model to select and refine the compatible candidate captions from prior knowledge. Given enriched captions, RiFeGAN uses self-attentional embedding mixtures to extract features across them effectually and handle the diverging features further. Then it exploits multi-captions attentional generative adversarial networks to synthesize images from those features. The experiments conducted on widely-used datasets show that the models can generate images from enriched captions effectually and improve the results significantly."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdCwErjIcVg,"This work investigates the task of unsupervised model personalization, adapted to continually evolving, unlabeled local user images. We consider the practical scenario where a high capacity server interacts with a myriad of resource-limited edge devices, imposing strong requirements on scalability and local data privacy. We aim to address this challenge within the continual learning paradigm and provide a novel Dual User-Adaptation framework (DUA) to explore the problem. This framework flexibly disentangles user-adaptation into model personalization on the server and local data regularization on the user device, with desirable properties regarding scalability and privacy constraints. First, on the server, we introduce incremental learning of task-specific expert models, subsequently aggregated using a concealed unsupervised user prior. Aggregation avoids retraining, whereas the user prior conceals sensitive raw user data, and grants unsupervised adaptation. Second, local user-adaptation incorporates a domain adaptation point of view, adapting regularizing batch normalization parameters to the user data. We explore various empirical user configurations with different priors in categories and a tenfold of transforms for MIT Indoor Scene recognition, and classify numbers in a combined MNIST and SVHN setup. Extensive experiments yield promising results for data-driven local adaptation and elicit user priors for server adaptation to depend on the model rather than user data. Hence, although user-adaptation remains a challenging open problem, the DUA framework formalizes a principled foundation for personalizing both on server and user device, while maintaining privacy and scalability."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejykgyDF4hA,"Assessing action quality from videos has attracted growing attention in recent years. Most existing approaches usually tackle this problem based on regression algorithms, which ignore the intrinsic ambiguity in the score labels caused by multiple judges or their subjective appraisals. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-aware score distribution learning (USDL) approach for action quality assessment (AQA). Specifically, we regard an action as an instance associated with a score distribution, which describes the probability of different evaluated scores. Moreover, under the circumstance where finer-grained score labels are available (e.g., difficulty degree of an action or multiple scores from different judges), we further devise a multi-path uncertainty-aware score distribution learning (MUSDL) method to explore the disentangled components of a score. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, We conduct experiments on two AQA datasets containing various Olympic actions. Our approaches set new state-of-the-arts under the Spearman's Rank Correlation (i.e., 0.8102 on AQA-7 and 0.9273 on MTL-AQA)."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPT4nsCkT5Q,"The fusion of multimodal sensor streams, such as camera, lidar, and radar measurements, plays a critical role in object detection for autonomous vehicles, which base their decision making on these inputs. While existing methods exploit redundant information in good environmental conditions, they fail in adverse weather where the sensory streams can be asymmetrically distorted. These rare ""edge-case"" scenarios are not represented in available datasets, and existing fusion architectures are not designed to handle them. To address this challenge we present a novel multimodal dataset acquired in over 10,000 km of driving in northern Europe. Although this dataset is the first large multimodal dataset in adverse weather, with 100k labels for lidar, camera, radar, and gated NIR sensors, it does not facilitate training as extreme weather is rare. To this end, we present a deep fusion network for robust fusion without a large corpus of labeled training data covering all asymmetric distortions. Departing from proposal-level fusion, we propose a single-shot model that adaptively fuses features, driven by measurement entropy. We validate the proposed method, trained on clean data, on our extensive validation dataset. Code and data are available here https://github.com/princeton-computational-imaging/SeeingThroughFog."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUMp7Mbxjs0,"Deep neural networks for video action recognition frequently require 3D convolutional filters and often encounter overfitting due to a larger number of parameters. In this paper, we propose Random Mean Scaling (RMS), a simple and effective regularization method, to relieve the overfitting problem in 3D residual networks. The key idea of RMS is to randomly vary the magnitude of low-frequency components of the feature to regularize the model. The low-frequency component can be derived by a spatio-temporal mean on the local patch of a feature. We present that selective regularization on this locally smoothed feature makes a model handle the low-frequency and high-frequency component distinctively, resulting in performance improvement. RMS can enhance a model with little additional computation only during training, similar to other regularization methods. RMS also can be incorporated into typical training process without any bells and whistles. Experimental results show the improvement in generalization performance on a popular action recognition datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of RMS as a regularization technique, compared to other state-of-the-art regularization methods."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ume9kIkI_ZQ,"Large-scale synthetic datasets are beneficial to stereo matching but usually introduce known domain bias. Although unsupervised image-to-image translation networks represented by CycleGAN show great potential in dealing with domain gap, it is non-trivial to generalize this method to stereo matching due to the problem of pixel distortion and stereo mismatch after translation. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end training framework with domain translation and stereo matching networks to tackle this challenge. First, joint optimization between domain translation and stereo matching networks in our end-to-end framework makes the former facilitate the latter one to the maximum extent. Second, this framework introduces two novel losses, i.e., bidirectional multi-scale feature re-projection loss and correlation consistency loss, to help translate all synthetic stereo images into realistic ones as well as maintain epipolar constraints. The effective combination of above two contributions leads to impressive stereo-consistent translation and disparity estimation accuracy. In addition, a mode seeking regularization term is added to endow the synthetic-to-real translation results with higher fine-grained diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on bridging the synthetic-to-real domain gap on stereo matching."

These methods commonly require to update source classifier to adapt to the target domain and do not properly handle the trade-off between the source domain and the target domain. In this work, instead of training a classifier to adapt to the target domain, we use a separable component called data calibrator to help the fixed source classifier recover discrimination power in the target domain, while preserving the source domain's performance. When the difference between two domains is small, the source classifier's representation is sufficient to perform well in the target domain and outperforms GAN-based methods in digits. Otherwise, the proposed method can leverage synthetic images generated by GANs to boost performance and achieve state-of-the-art performance in digits datasets and driving scene semantic segmentation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XO3ybwAdsM,"We present a novel approach to category-level 6D object pose and size estimation. To tackle intra-class shape variations, we learn canonical shape space (CASS), a unified representation for a large variety of instances of a certain object category. In particular, CASS is modeled as the latent space of a deep generative model of canonical 3D shapes with normalized pose. We train a variational auto-encoder (VAE) for generating 3D point clouds in the canonical space from an RGBD image. The VAE is trained in a cross-category fashion, exploiting the publicly available large 3D shape repositories. Since the 3D point cloud is generated in normalized pose (with actual size), the encoder of the VAE learns view-factorized RGBD embedding. It maps an RGBD image in arbitrary view into a poseindependent 3D shape representation. Object pose is then estimated via contrasting it with a pose-dependent feature of the input RGBD extracted with a separate deep neural networks. We integrate the learning of CASS and pose and size estimation into an end-to-end trainable network, achieving the state-of-the-art performance."

Specifically, (1) we use hierarchical clustering to generate pseudo labels, (2) we use PK sampling in each iteration to generate a new dataset for training, (3) we conduct training with hard-batch triplet loss and evaluate model performance in each iteration. We evaluate our model on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID. Results show that HCT achieves 56.4% mAP on Market-1501 and 50.7% mAP on DukeMTMC-reID which surpasses state-of-the-arts a lot in fully unsupervised re-ID and even better than most unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods which use the labeled source dataset.

The existing methods, however, make these selections in a rough and inflexible way, compromising their performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach which utilizes reinforcement learning to make these two decisions at the same time. Specifically, the reinforcement learning agent learns to decide whether to update the target template according to the quality of the predicted result. The choice of the matching method will be determined at the same time, based on the action history of the reinforcement learning agent. Experiments show that our method is almost 10 times faster than the previous state-of-the-art method with even higher accuracy (region similarity of 69.1% on DAVIS 2017 dataset)."

A key challenge for current deep reinforcement learning models lies in the requirements for a large amount of training data. It is exceedingly expensive to construct sufficient 3D synthetic environments annotated with the target object information. In this paper, we focus on visual navigation in the low-resource setting, where we have only a few training environments annotated with object information. We propose a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning approach to learn transferable meta-skills (e.g., bypass obstacles, go straight) from unannotated environments without any supervisory signals. The agent can then fast adapt to visual navigation through learning a high-level master policy to combine these meta-skills, when the visual-navigation-specified reward is provided. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline by 53.34% relatively on SPL, and further qualitative analysis demonstrates that our method learns transferable motor primitives for visual navigation."

In this work, a novel approach is proposed to online automatically and adaptively learn spatio-temporal regularization term. Spatially local response map variation is introduced as spatial regularization to make DCF focus on the learning of trust-worthy parts of the object, and global response map variation determines the updating rate of the filter.

Although progress has been made, there are still several issues within the existing methods. First, existing methods transfer knowledge from source data to target tasks by learning domain-invariant features, but they ignore to preserve domain-specific knowledge. Second, the transfer subspace learning is employed in either low-level or high-level feature spaces, but few methods consider fusing multi-level features for subspace learning. To this end, we propose a novel multi-mutual consistency induced transfer subspace learning framework for human motion segmentation. Specifically, our model factorizes the source and target data into distinct multi-layer feature spaces and reduces the distribution gap between them through a multi-mutual consistency learning strategy. In this way, the domain-specific knowledge and domain-invariant properties can be explored simultaneously. Our model also conducts the transfer subspace learning on different layers to capture multi-level structural information. Further, to preserve the temporal correlations, we project the learned representations into a block-like space. The proposed model is efficiently optimized by using the Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) algorithm. Experimental results on four human motion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over other state-of-the-art approaches."

Moreover, our approach provides a thorough theoretical derivation, interpretation, and justification for the application of depthwise separable convolutions (DSCs) in general, which have become the basis of many modern network architectures. Ultimately, we reveal that DSC-based architectures such as MobileNets implicitly rely on cross-kernel correlations, while our BSConv formulation is based on intra-kernel correlations and thus allows for a more efficient separation of regular convolutions. Extensive experiments on large-scale and fine-grained classification datasets show that BSConvs clearly and consistently improve MobileNets and other DSC-based architectures without introducing any further complexity.

However, as on-policy data is sequentially sampled and added in an iterative manner, the policy can specialize and overfit to the training conditions. For real-world applications, it is useful for the learned policy to generalize to novel scenarios that differ from the training conditions. To improve policy learning while maintaining robustness when training end-to-end driving policies, we perform an extensive analysis of data aggregation techniques in the CARLA environment. We demonstrate how the majority of them have poor generalization performance, and develop a novel approach with empirically better generalization performance compared to existing techniques. Our two key ideas are (1) to sample critical states from the collected on-policy data based on the utility they provide to the learned policy in terms of driving behavior, and (2) to incorporate a replay buffer which progressively focuses on the high uncertainty regions of the policy's state distribution. We evaluate the proposed approach on the CARLA NoCrash benchmark, focusing on the most challenging driving scenarios with dense pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Our approach improves driving success rate by 16% over state-of-the-art, achieving 87% of the expert performance while also reducing the collision rate by an order of magnitude without the use of any additional modality, auxiliary tasks, architectural modifications or reward from the environment."

In particular, relative spatial reasoning and structural connections between objects are essential cues for analyzing interactions, which is addressed by the proposed Visual-Spatial-Graph Network (VSGNet) architecture. VSGNet extracts visual features from the human-object pairs, refines the features with spatial configurations of the pair, and utilizes the structural connections between the pair via graph convolutions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWYTLZUgxjY,"One of the long-term challenges of robotics is to enable robots to interact with humans in the visual world via natural language, as humans are visual animals that communicate through language. Overcoming this challenge requires the ability to perform a wide variety of complex tasks in response to multifarious instructions from humans. In the hope that it might drive progress towards more flexible and powerful human interactions with robots, we propose a dataset of varied and complex robot tasks, described in natural language, in terms of objects visible in a large set of real images. Given an instruction, success requires navigating through a previously-unseen environment to identify an object. This represents a practical challenge, but one that closely reflects one of the core visual problems in robotics. Several state-of-the-art vision-and-language navigation, and referring-expression models are tested to verify the difficulty of this new task, but none of them show promising results because there are many fundamental differences between our task and previous ones. A novel Interactive Navigator-Pointer model is also proposed that provides a strong baseline on the task. The proposed model especially achieves the best performance on the unseen test split, but still leaves substantial room for improvement compared to the human performance.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B8CYhxWK38,"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results on Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). Despite considering only a single degradation, recent studies also include multiple degrading effects to better reflect real-world cases. However, most of the works assume a fixed combination of degrading effects, or even train an individual network for different combinations. Instead, a more practical approach is to train a single network for wide-ranging and variational degradations. To fulfill this requirement, this paper proposes a unified network to accommodate the variations from inter-image (cross-image variations) and intra-image (spatial variations). Different from the existing works, we incorporate dynamic convolution which is a far more flexible alternative to handle different variations. In SISR with non-blind setting, our Unified Dynamic Convolutional Network for Variational Degradations (UDVD) is evaluated on both synthetic and real images with an extensive set of variations. The qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of UDVD over various existing works. Extensive experiments show that our UDVD achieves favorable or comparable performance on both synthetic and real images."

While most of the recent attack methods target at digital-world adversarial scenarios, it is unclear how they perform in the physical world, and more importantly, the generated perturbations under such methods would cover a whole driving scene including those fixed background imagery such as the sky, making them inapplicable to physical world implementation. We present PhysGAN, which generates physical-world-resilient adversarial examples for misleading autonomous driving systems in a continuous manner. We show the effectiveness and robustness of PhysGAN via extensive digital- and real-world evaluations. We compare PhysGAN with a set of state-of-the-art baseline methods, which further demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of our approach. We also show that PhysGAN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, PhysGAN is probably the first technique of generating realistic and physical-world-resilient adversarial examples for attacking common autonomous driving scenarios."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCRN6Zy_9AU,"The reconstruction of shredded documents consists in arranging the pieces of paper (shreds) in order to reassemble the original aspect of such documents. This task is particularly relevant for supporting forensic investigation as documents may contain criminal evidence. As an alternative to the laborious and time-consuming manual process, several researchers have been investigating ways to perform automatic digital reconstruction. A central problem in automatic reconstruction of shredded documents is the pairwise compatibility evaluation of the shreds, notably for binary text documents. In this context, deep learning has enabled great progress for accurate reconstructions in the domain of mechanically-shredded documents. A sensitive issue, however, is that current deep model solutions require an inference whenever a pair of shreds has to be evaluated. This work proposes a scalable deep learning approach for measuring pairwise compatibility in which the number of inferences scales linearly (rather than quadratically) with the number of shreds. Instead of predicting compatibility directly, deep models are leveraged to asymmetrically project the raw shred content onto a common metric space in which distance is proportional to the compatibility. Experimental results show that our method has accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art with a speed-up of about 22 times for a test instance with 505 shreds (20 mixed shredded-pages from different documents)."

Recognized precise object models will play an important role alongside non-parametric reconstructions of unrecognized structures. We present a system which can estimate the accurate poses of multiple known objects in contact and occlusion from real-time, embodied multi-view vision. Our approach makes 3D object pose proposals from single RGB-D views, accumulates pose estimates and non-parametric occupancy information from multiple views as the camera moves, and performs joint optimization to estimate consistent, non-intersecting poses for multiple objects in contact. We verify the accuracy and robustness of our approach experimentally on 2 object datasets: YCB-Video, and our own challenging Cluttered YCB-Video. We demonstrate a real-time robotics application where a robot arm precisely and orderly disassembles complicated piles of objects, using only on-board RGB-D vision."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcZD6oyX1eI,"Batch Normalization (BN) uses mini-batch statistics to normalize the activations during training, introducing dependence between mini-batch elements. This dependency can hurt the performance if the mini-batch size is too small, or if the elements are correlated. Several alternatives, such as Batch Renormalization and Group Normalization (GN), have been proposed to address this issue. However, they either do not match the performance of BN for large batches, or still exhibit degradation in performance for smaller batches, or introduce artificial constraints on the model architecture. In this paper we propose the Filter Response Normalization (FRN) layer, a novel combination of a normalization and an activation function, that can be used as a replacement for other normalizations and activations. Our method operates on each activation channel of each batch element independently, eliminating the dependency on other batch elements. Our method outperforms BN and other alternatives in a variety of settings for all batch sizes. FRN layer performs 0.7-1.0% better than BN on top-1 validation accuracy with large mini-batch sizes for Imagenet classification using InceptionV3 and ResnetV2-50 architectures. Further, it performs >1% better than GN on the same problem in the small mini-batch size regime. For object detection problem on COCO dataset, FRN layer outperforms all other methods by at least 0.3-0.5% in all batch size regimes."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq7NRq1OQEo,"Enabling bi-directional retrieval of images and texts is important for understanding the correspondence between vision and language. Existing methods leverage the attention mechanism to explore such correspondence in a fine-grained manner. However, most of them consider all semantics equally and thus align them uniformly, regardless of their diverse complexities. In fact, semantics are diverse (i.e. involving different kinds of semantic concepts), and humans usually follow a latent structure to combine them into understandable languages. It may be difficult to optimally capture such sophisticated correspondences in existing methods. In this paper, to address such a deficiency, we propose an Iterative Matching with Recurrent Attention Memory (IMRAM) method, in which correspondences between images and texts are captured with multiple steps of alignments. Specifically, we introduce an iterative matching scheme to explore such fine-grained correspondence progressively. A memory distillation unit is used to refine alignment knowledge from early steps to later ones. Experiment results on three benchmark datasets, i.e. Flickr8K, Flickr30K, and MS COCO, show that our IMRAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, well demonstrating its effectiveness. Experiments on a practical business advertisement dataset, named KWAI-AD, further validates the applicability of our method in practical scenarios."

We propose an alternative approach in which the convolutional layers are advantageously replaced with encoders operating on unordered sets of pixels to exploit the typically coarse resolution of publicly available satellite images. We also propose to extract temporal features using a bespoke neural architecture based on self-attention instead of recurrent networks. We demonstrate experimentally that our method not only outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, but also significantly decreases processing time and memory requirements. Lastly, we release a large open-access annotated dataset as a benchmark for future work on satellite image time series."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcme-jLC8o,"Fast and effective image compression for multi-dimensional images has become increasingly important for efficient storage and transfer of massive amounts of high resolution images and videos. Desirable properties in compression methods include (1) high reconstruction quality at a wide range of compression rates while preserving key local details, (2) computational scalability, (3) applicability to a variety of different image/video types and of different dimensions, and (4) ease of tuning. We present such a method for multi-dimensional image compression called Compression via Adaptive Recursive Partitioning (CARP). CARP uses an optimal permutation of the image pixels inferred from a Bayesian probabilistic model on recursive partitions of the image to reduce its effective dimensionality, achieving a parsimonious representation that preserves information. CARP uses a multi-layer Bayesian hierarchical model to achieve self-tuning and regularization to avoid overfitting-- resulting in one single parameter to be specified by the user to achieve the desired compression rate. Extensive numerical experiments using a variety of datasets including 2D ImageNet, 3D medical image, and real-life YouTube and surveillance videos show that CARP dominates the state-of-the-art compression approaches-- including JPEG, JPEG2000, MPEG4, and a neural network-based method--for all of these different image types and often on nearly all of the individual images."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw1s8LWg1ss,"Answering questions that require reading texts in an image is challenging for current models. One key difficulty of this task is that rare, polysemous, and ambiguous words frequently appear in images, e.g., names of places, products, and sports teams. To overcome this difficulty, only resorting to pre-trained word embedding models is far from enough. A desired model should utilize the rich information in multiple modalities of the image to help understand the meaning of scene texts, e.g., the prominent text on a bottle is most likely to be the brand. Following this idea, we propose a novel VQA approach, Multi-Modal Graph Neural Network (MM-GNN). It first represents an image as a graph consisting of three sub-graphs, depicting visual, semantic, and numeric modalities respectively. Then, we introduce three aggregators which guide the message passing from one graph to another to utilize the contexts in various modalities, so as to refine the features of nodes. The updated nodes have better features for the downstream question answering module. Experimental evaluations show that our MM-GNN represents the scene texts better and obviously facilitates the performances on two VQA tasks that require reading scene texts."

Detection of adversarial examples is, therefore, a fundamental requirement for robust classification frameworks. In this work, we present a method for detecting such adversarial attacks, which is suitable for any pre-trained neural network classifier. We use influence functions to measure the impact of every training sample on the validation set data. From the influence scores, we find the most supportive training samples for any given validation example. A k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model fitted on the DNN's activation layers is employed to search for the ranking of these supporting training samples. We observe that these samples are highly correlated with the nearest neighbors of the normal inputs, while this correlation is much weaker for adversarial inputs. We train an adversarial detector using the k-NN ranks and distances and show that it successfully distinguishes adversarial examples, getting state-of-the-art results on six attack methods with three datasets.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMm-mVKP7hg,"Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors usually focus on the single-frame detection, while ignoring the spatiotemporal information in consecutive point cloud frames. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end online 3D video object detector that operates on point cloud sequences. The proposed model comprises a spatial feature encoding component and a spatiotemporal feature aggregation component. In the former component, a novel Pillar Message Passing Network (PMPNet) is proposed to encode each discrete point cloud frame. It adaptively collects information for a pillar node from its neighbors by iterative message passing, which effectively enlarges the receptive field of the pillar feature. In the latter component, we propose an Attentive Spatiotemporal Transformer GRU (AST-GRU) to aggregate the spatiotemporal information, which enhances the conventional ConvGRU with an attentive memory gating mechanism. AST-GRU contains a Spatial Transformer Attention (STA) module and a Temporal Transformer Attention (TTA) module, which can emphasize the foreground objects and align the dynamic objects, respectively.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0RnEtkCFi0,"Monocular 3D object detection is an essential component in autonomous driving while challenging to solve, especially for those occluded samples which are only partially visible. Most detectors consider each 3D object as an independent training target, inevitably resulting in a lack of useful information for occluded samples. To this end, we propose a novel method to improve the monocular 3D object detection by considering the relationship of paired samples. This allows us to encode spatial constraints for partially-occluded objects from their adjacent neighbors. Specifically, the proposed detector computes uncertainty-aware predictions for object locations and 3D distances for the adjacent object pairs, which are subsequently jointly optimized by nonlinear least squares. Finally, the one-stage uncertainty-aware prediction structure and the post-optimization module are dedicatedly integrated for ensuring the run-time efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields the best performance on KITTI 3D detection benchmark, by outperforming state-of-the-art competitors by wide margins, especially for the hard samples."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBY4gycGzXM,"Estimating the 3D pose of desktop objects is crucial for applications such as robotic manipulation. Many existing approaches to this problem require a depth map of the object for both training and prediction, which restricts them to opaque, lambertian objects that produce good returns in an RGBD sensor. In this paper we forgo using a depth sensor in favor of raw stereo input. We address two problems: first, we establish an easy method for capturing and labeling 3D keypoints on desktop objects with an RGB camera; and second, we develop a deep neural network, called KeyPose, that learns to accurately predict object poses using 3D keypoints, from stereo input, and works even for transparent objects. To evaluate the performance of our method, we create a dataset of 15 clear objects in five classes, with 48K 3D-keypoint labeled images. We train both instance and category models, and show generalization to new textures, poses, and objects. KeyPose surpasses state-of-the-art performance in 3D pose estimation on this dataset by factors of 1.5 to 3.5, even in cases where the competing method is provided with ground-truth depth. Stereo input is essential for this performance as it improves results compared to using monocular input by a factor of 2. We will release a public version of the data capture and labeling pipeline, the transparent object database, and the KeyPose models and evaluation code.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxV3ZxSjvwc,"Object detection has achieved remarkable progress in the past decade. However, the detection of oriented and densely packed objects remains challenging because of following inherent reasons: (1) receptive fields of neurons are all axis-aligned and of the same shape, whereas objects are usually of diverse shapes and align along various directions; (2) detection models are typically trained with generic knowledge and may not generalize well to handle specific objects at test time; (3) the limited dataset hinders the development on this task. To resolve the first two issues, we present a dynamic refinement network that consists of two novel components, i.e., a feature selection module (FSM) and a dynamic refinement head (DRH). Our FSM enables neurons to adjust receptive fields in accordance with the shapes and orientations of target objects, whereas the DRH empowers our model to refine the prediction dynamically in an object-aware manner. To address the limited availability of related benchmarks, we collect an extensive and fully annotated dataset, namely, SKU110K-R, which is relabeled with oriented bounding boxes based on SKU110K. We perform quantitative evaluations on several publicly available benchmarks including DOTA, HRSC2016, SKU110K, and our own SKU110K-R dataset.

By formulating a surrogate two-class ordinal regression task we devise an end-to-end trainable video anomaly detection approach that enables joint representation learning and anomaly scoring without manually labeled normal/abnormal data. Experiments on eight real-world video scenes show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods that require no labeled training data by a substantial margin, and enables easy and accurate localization of the identified anomalies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method offers effective human-in-the-loop anomaly detection which can be critical in applications where anomalies are rare and the false-negative cost is high."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF8_ico4L8w,"Most of the existing person re-identification (re-ID) methods achieve promising accuracy in a supervised manner, but they assume the identity labels of the target domain is available. This greatly limits the scalability of person re-ID in real-world scenarios. Therefore, the current person re-ID community focuses on the cross-domain person re-ID that aims to transfer the knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain and exploits the specific knowledge from the data distribution of the target domain to further improve the performance. To reduce the gap between the source and target domains, we propose a Smoothing Adversarial Domain Attack (SADA) approach that guides the source domain images to align the target domain images by using a trained camera classifier. To stabilize a memory trace of cross-domain knowledge transfer after its initial acquisition from the source domain, we propose a p-Memory Reconsolidation (pMR) method that reconsolidates the source knowledge with a small probability p during the self-training of the target domain. With both SADA and pMR, the proposed method significantly improves the cross-domain person re-ID. Extensive experiments on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID benchmarks show that our pMR-SADA outperforms all of the state-of-the-arts by a large margin."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1_5RXBP_No,"Current methods for depth map prediction from monocular images tend to predict smooth, poorly localized contours for the occlusion boundaries in the input image. This is unfortunate as occlusion boundaries are important cues to recognize objects, and as we show, may lead to a way to discover new objects from scene reconstruction. To improve predicted depth maps, recent methods rely on various forms of filtering or predict an additive residual depth map to refine a first estimate. We instead learn to predict, given a depth map predicted by some reconstruction method, a 2D displacement field able to re-sample pixels around the occlusion boundaries into sharper reconstructions. Our method can be applied to the output of any depth estimation method, in an end-to-end trainable fashion. For evaluation, we manually annotated the occlusion boundaries in all the images in the test split of popular NYUv2-Depth dataset. We show that our approach improves the localization of occlusion boundaries for all state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods that we could evaluate, without degrading the depth accuracy for the rest of the images."

Despite considerable advance, the reasons on effectiveness of GCP on deep CNNs have not been well studied. In this paper, we make an attempt to understand what deep CNNs benefit from GCP in a viewpoint of optimization. Specifically, we explore the effect of GCP on deep CNNs in terms of the Lipschitzness of optimization loss and the predictiveness of gradients, and show that GCP can make the optimization landscape more smooth and the gradients more predictive. Furthermore, we discuss the connection between GCP and second-order optimization for deep CNNs. More importantly, above findings can account for several merits of covariance pooling for training deep CNNs that have not been recognized previously or fully explored, including significant acceleration of network convergence (i.e., the networks trained with GCP can support rapid decay of learning rates, achieving favorable performance while significantly reducing number of training epochs), stronger robustness to distorted examples generated by image corruptions and perturbations, and good generalization ability to different vision tasks, e.g., object detection and instance segmentation.

The proposed SDGN model enjoys several merits. First, we design a cross-domain feature generating module to synthesize samples with high fidelity based on class embeddings, which involves a novel target domain discriminator to preserve the domain consistency. Second, we propose a self-supervised learning module to investigate inter-domain relationships, where a set of anchors are introduced as a bridge between seen and unseen categories. In the shared space, we pull the distribution of target domain away from source domain, and obtain domain-aware features with high discriminative power for both seen and unseen classes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWtPU_LkW2w,"Although significant progress has been made in pedestrian detection recently, pedestrian detection in crowded scenes is still challenging. The heavy occlusion between pedestrians imposes great challenges to the standard Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). A relative low threshold of intersection over union (IoU) leads to missing highly overlapped pedestrians, while a higher one brings in plenty of false positives. To avoid such a dilemma, this paper proposes a novel Representative Region NMS (R2NMS) approach leveraging the less occluded visible parts, effectively removing the redundant boxes without bringing in many false positives. To acquire the visible parts, a novel Paired-Box Model (PBM) is proposed to simultaneously predict the full and visible boxes of a pedestrian. The full and visible boxes constitute a pair serving as the sample unit of the model, thus guaranteeing a strong correspondence between the two boxes throughout the detection pipeline. Moreover, convenient feature integration of the two boxes is allowed for the better performance on both full and visible pedestrian detection tasks. Experiments on the challenging CrowdHuman and CityPersons benchmarks sufficiently validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on pedestrian detection in the crowded situation."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6YgWQIz-Ac,"Manifold-valued data naturally arises in medical imaging. In cognitive neuroscience for instance, brain connectomes base the analysis of coactivation patterns between different brain regions on the analysis of the correlations of their functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series - an object thus constrained by construction to belong to the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. One of the challenges that naturally arises in these studies consists in finding a lower-dimensional subspace for representing such manifold-valued and typically high-dimensional data. Traditional techniques, like principal component analysis, are ill-adapted to tackle non-Euclidean spaces and may fail to achieve a lower-dimensional representation of the data - thus potentially pointing to the absence of lower-dimensional representation of the data. However, these techniques are restricted in that: (i) they do not leverage the assumption that the connectomes belong on a pre-specified manifold, therefore discarding information; (ii) they can only fit a linear subspace to the data. In this paper, we are interested in variants to learn potentially highly curved submanifolds of manifold-valued data. Motivated by the brain connectomes example, we investigate a latent variable generative model, which has the added benefit of providing us with uncertainty estimates - a crucial quantity in the medical applications we are considering. While latent variable models have been proposed to learn linear and nonlinear spaces for Euclidean data, or geodesic subspaces for manifold data, no intrinsic latent variable model exists to learn non-geodesic subspaces for manifold data. This paper fills this gap and formulates a Riemannian variational autoencoder with an intrinsic generative model of manifold-valued data. We evaluate its performances on synthetic and real datasets, by introducing the formalism of weighted Riemannian submanifolds."

Our results show an improvement over the state of art by 20% on the Final Displacement Error (FDE) and an improvement on the Average Displacement Error (ADE) with 8.5 times less parameters and up to 48 times faster inference speed than previously reported methods. In addition, our model is data efficient, and exceeds previous state of the art on the ADE metric with only 20% of the training data.

The few-shot learning problem has attracted increasing attention from researchers for building a robust model upon only a few labeled samples. Most existing works tackle this problem under the meta-learning framework by mimicking the few-shot learning task with an episodic training strategy. In this paper, we propose a new transfer-learning framework for semi-supervised few-shot learning to fully utilize the auxiliary information from labeled base-class data and unlabeled novel-class data. The framework consists of three components: 1) pre-training a feature extractor on base-class data; 2) using the feature extractor to initialize the classifier weights for the novel classes; and 3) further updating the model with a semi-supervised learning method. Under the proposed framework, we develop a novel method for semi-supervised few-shot learning called TransMatch by instantiating the three components with imprinting and MixMatch. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets for few-shot learning, CUB-200-2011 and miniImageNet, demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively utilize the auxiliary information from labeled base-class data and unlabeled novel-class data to significantly improve the accuracy of few-shot learning task, and achieve new state-of-the-art results."

Second we show that framing the optimisation as permutation matrix inference via Sinkhorn iterations is more effective than the common classifier formulation of Jigsaw self-supervision. Experiments show that this self-supervised pre-training strategy significantly outperforms the standard ImageNet-based pipeline across all four product-level FG-SBIR benchmarks. Interestingly it also leads to improved cross-category generalisation across both pre-train/fine-tune and fine-tune/testing stages."

Current referring expression methods have achieved good performance. However, none of them is able to achieve real-time inference without accuracy drop. The reason for the relatively slow inference speed is that these methods artificially split the referring expression comprehension into two sequential stages including proposal generation and proposal ranking. It does not exactly conform to the habit of human cognition. To this end, we propose a novel Realtime Cross-modality Correlation Filtering method (RCCF). RCCF reformulates the referring expression comprehension as a correlation filtering process. The expression is first mapped from the language domain to the visual domain and then treated as a template (kernel) to perform correlation filtering on the image feature map. The peak value in the correlation heatmap indicates the center points of the target box. In addition, RCCF also regresses a 2-D object size and 2-D offset. The center point coordinates, object size and center point offset together to form the target bounding box. Our method runs at 40 FPS while achieving leading performance in RefClef, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg benchmarks. In the challenging RefClef dataset, our methods almost double the state-of-the-art performance (34.70% increased to 63.79%). We hope this work can arouse more attention and studies to the new cross-modality correlation filtering framework as well as the one-stage framework for referring expression comprehension."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRrCzCQNICI,"We present a fast feature-metric point cloud registration framework, which enforces the optimisation of registration by minimising a feature-metric projection error without correspondences. The advantage of the feature-metric projection error is robust to noise, outliers and density difference in contrast to the geometric projection error. Besides, minimising the feature-metric projection error does not need to search the correspondences so that the optimisation speed is fast. The principle behind the proposed method is that the feature difference is smallest if point clouds are aligned very well. We train the proposed method in a semi-supervised or unsupervised approach, which requires limited or no registration label data. Experiments demonstrate our method obtains higher accuracy and robustness than the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, experimental results show that the proposed method can handle significant noise and density difference, and solve both same-source and cross-source point cloud registration."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ErgbHYfOzI,"Learning to navigate in a visual environment following natural-language instructions is a challenging task, because the multimodal inputs to the agent are highly variable, and the training data on a new task is often limited. In this paper, we present the first pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks. By training on a large amount of image-text-action triplets in a self-supervised learning manner, the pre-trained model provides generic representations of visual environments and language instructions. It can be easily used as a drop-in for existing VLN frameworks, leading to the proposed agent PREVALENT. It learns more effectively in new tasks and generalizes better in a previously unseen environment. The performance is validated on three VLN tasks. On the Room-to-Room benchmark, our model improves the state-of-the-art from 47% to 51% on success rate weighted by path length. Further, the learned representation is transferable to other VLN tasks. On two recent tasks, vision-and-dialog navigation and ""Help, Anna!"", the proposed PREVALENT leads to significant improvement over existing methods, achieving a new state of the art."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIxvUuoT0Cg,"Depth completion recovers dense depth from sparse measurements, e.g., LiDAR. Existing depth-only methods use sparse depth as the only input. However, these methods may fail to recover semantics consistent boundaries, or small/thin objects due to 1) the sparse nature of depth points and 2) the lack of images to provide semantic cues. This paper continues this line of research and aims to overcome the above shortcomings. The unique design of our depth completion model is that it simultaneously outputs a reconstructed image and a dense depth map. Specifically, we formulate image reconstruction from sparse depth as an auxiliary task during training that is supervised by the unlabelled gray-scale images. During testing, our system accepts sparse depth as the only input, i.e., the image is not required. Our design allows the depth completion network to learn complementary image features that help to better understand object structures. The extra supervision incurred by image reconstruction is minimal, because no annotations other than the image are needed. We evaluate our method on the KITTI depth completion benchmark and show that depth completion can be significantly improved via the auxiliary supervision of image reconstruction. Our algorithm consistently outperforms depth-only methods and is also effective for indoor scenes like NYUv2."

Although recent works have achieved highly realistic results on synthesizing or controlling human head images, the puppeteering of arbitrary portraits is still confronted by the following challenges: 1) identity/personality mismatch; 2) training data/domain limitations; and 3) low-efficiency in training/fine-tuning. In this paper, we devised a novel two-stage framework called PuppeteerGAN for solving these challenges. Specifically, we first learn identity-preserved semantic segmentation animation which executes pose retargeting between any portraits. As a general representation, the semantic segmentation results could be adapted to different datasets, environmental conditions or appearance domains. Furthermore, the synthesized semantic segmentation is filled with the appearance of the source portrait. To this end, an appearance transformation network is presented to produce fidelity output by jointly considering the wrapping of semantic features and conditional generation. After training, the two networks can directly perform end-to-end inference on unseen subjects without any retraining or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on cross-identity/domain/resolution situations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PuppetterGAN over existing portrait animation methods in both generation quality and inference speed."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c25XccOQ7UQ,"In this paper, we consider a novel task, Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding for Multi-Form Sentences (STVG). Given an untrimmed video and a declarative/interrogative sentence depicting an object, STVG aims to localize the spatio-temporal tube of the queried object. STVG has two challenging settings: (1) We need to localize spatio-temporal object tubes from untrimmed videos, where the object may only exist in a very small segment of the video; (2) We deal with multi-form sentences, including the declarative sentences with explicit objects and interrogative sentences with unknown objects. Existing methods cannot tackle the STVG task due to the ineffective tube pre-generation and the lack of object relationship modeling. Thus, we then propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Reasoning Network (STGRN) for this task. First, we build a spatio-temporal region graph to capture the region relationships with temporal object dynamics, which involves the implicit and explicit spatial subgraphs in each frame and the temporal dynamic subgraph across frames. We then incorporate textual clues into the graph and develop the multi-step cross-modal graph reasoning. Next, we introduce a spatio-temporal localizer with a dynamic selection method to directly retrieve the spatio-temporal tubes without tube pre-generation. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale video grounding dataset VidSTG based on video relation dataset VidOR. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f113k0CZyfw,"To leverage deep learning for image aesthetics assessment, one critical but unsolved issue is how to seamlessly incorporate the information of image aspect ratios to learn more robust models. In this paper, an adaptive fractional dilated convolution (AFDC), which is aspect-ratio-embedded, composition-preserving and parameter-free, is developed to tackle this issue natively in convolutional kernel level. Specifically, the fractional dilated kernel is adaptively constructed according to the image aspect ratios, where the interpolation of nearest two integer dilated kernels are used to cope with the misalignment of fractional sampling. Moreover, we provide a concise formulation for mini-batch training and utilize a grouping strategy to reduce computational overhead. As a result, it can be easily implemented by common deep learning libraries and plugged into popular CNN architectures in a computation-efficient manner. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image aesthetics assessment over the AVA dataset."
